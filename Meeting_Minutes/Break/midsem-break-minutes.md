| have a foundation    |  ANU has a similar thing|
| q&a (data issue) |Basics already done by ANU|
| a lot of competition | Need more foundation| 
| no meaning on its own| very useful. It is the demand |
| | can be a stand-alone product; can also benefit from the search|


* try to replicate what's there in the ANU website. Build on top of that.
* build your profucts incrementally; maybe consider a few colleges, or a few degrees
* Consider building degrees for: Actuarial Studies
* Q&A could be a different product; out of current scope; don't focus on it right now; sounds cool though
