### Bradley's feedback

* Get rid of animations- they bring in unnnecessary delays. Focus on what's important. Highlight the important info.
* Interactive planner should have been explained more
* The animations can be performed while we speak- don't pause for 2 to 3s for it.
* Good to add about the lessons learnt especially on the technical side.
* Use a lot of numbers in the slides. More effective than text. Mention numbers in the presentation instead of just speaking them.
* Work on the presentation more- need to manage the time better. practice speaking- have a script.
* Use importatn keywords- eg. machine learning
* Good comparison with the current system
* Quality over quantity- keep everything up to date. Don't delete old stuff.
* Keep the presentatiom short and powerful.
* Take pictures of weekly meetings and upload them? Depicts a good client relationship

<h3>TODO:</h3> Create a spreadsheet with all the features- mark the ones that we are gonna prioritise (lookup scrum poker). List these on trello with the effort points for them (create tags too). break into sprints (One for each week, where tasks are assigned).
