## Accenture Meeting - Week 4 - Minutes

### First part

Audit 2 in two weeks
	- What to build for a prototype ?
	- Focus on the presentation
	- Any other requirements (Joseph: find out)?
	
### Second part

Derrick: Should we move on to ideate?
Everyone: yes

Derrick: Change the order of the questions in the survey?
There was a general consensus that the longer questions in the beginning would deter users from filling the whole thing.

TO DO immediately:

* Distribute survey
* Final poll question (Jack and Joseph)

--

Current Data:

- Chatbot responses
- Survey responses
- Interview

All of this data needs to be summarised and presented (in the audit and Derrick as well) appropriately.

During the audit _do_ emphasise that our prototype is based upon the data that was collected through various means.

--

Before next meeting:

 - Summarise the data points. What does the data tell us?
 - Continue discussion with ANUSA. The more data we have, the better it is for us.
 - Agree on what type of prototype is chosen and the basic use cases.
 - Look into the technological aspects for the prototype and long term (Tom).
 - Can SELT Data be obtained?

--

To consider for the prototype:

* Use Cases
* Technologies
* Features
* Who does what?

--

Derrick: Don't worry about popularity/usability when deciding between chatbot and website. The flexibility lies with us. Choose one quickly. 
Irrespective of what we choose, we should be able to back our decisions.


For the 26th, 

 - recommendations based on ontologies. No need to scrape the whole the ANU data. Could work with courses from just a few colleges.
 - is the presentaion a video of the product or a live demo?
 - be realistic
 - don't need to explain ontologies and other concepts- focus on survey results and why we decided to build the product that we have

No need to go for something perfect; need to go incrementally; start from first year courses maybe, and then go on to include other years in that.

--

To consider in the near future:

* Who's gonna test our products? Need external parties for that.
* How to get the data? Scraping or ISIS database?
