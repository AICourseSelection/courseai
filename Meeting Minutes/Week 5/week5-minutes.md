## Accenture Meeting - Week 5 - Minutes

* One of us should represent Chris if he is not present. 
* Accenture's initial vision wrt the product was to suggest courses given the degree and required majors and minors. Interests would come later.
* Be more forthcoming with your decisions
* Should've done the assessment of the survey results and come up with the features before the meeting.
* Where AI can provide value- Course recommendation system, course search engine based on ontologies, chatbot with a database of questions(?)
* What is the website gonna have? Make a rigorous list of it before coming up with the design.
* For audit 1, be prepared to be asked on what milestones have we covered in these three weeks. Are we behind the plan?
* Why have we been marked low for the first audit? Ask the tutor/lecturer.
* Is what we're doing for audit 2 the way to go?
* Don't just be reliable on the demo- this could be risky. If we do proceed with this, be very clear about with how it and how it aligns with the client's goals etc. Derrick's and Bradley's recommendation: Create a journey- how we came up with the survey questions, how we decided on the features based on the answers, what we built based on it etc. Come up with infographics.
* What are we gonna present for the audit?
  * What were the important questions, their responses etc. 
  * Idea for the presentation- 6 slides (4 mins each) or 3 slides + demos etc. Not hard to fill 30min for 6 people. If going for a demo, what do we want to add to it? Also talk about the ontology, why do we think it's useful etc.
  * Slide: Start with how we've progressed with the timeline. Check the boxes we've covered.
  * Slide: One slide about the process of coming up with the Survey/ poll/ facebook/ face-to-face interview/ ANUSA. Needed to reach out to the students to ensure we build a relevant product blah blah blah.. Formed questions based on personal experience and talking to others.
  * Slide: Infographic about the results.
  * Slide: Feature list. How do we wanna display the features on the slide? a simple list, concentrix circles like what Tom suggested? Doesn't have to be comprehensive, we only just got the survey results, we're still in the ideate phase. Explain that the feature list will never be comprehesive, always changes based on demand.
  	* Intelligent course recommendation
  	* AI enhanced course search
  	* Interactive degree planner
  * Already covered in other slides: Challenges we faced? Ontology, indexing (for the demo), lessons learnt for the chatbot
  * **Demo follows**. Tom suggests either 
  	1. building an intelligent course recommendation system that suggests courses based on interests, and/or relation to degree. 
  	2. AI enhanced course search. Search for part of a keyword, and related courses show up.
  * Slide: Next steps
  * Add Tom's Architecture somewhere. Probably before the demo and after the feature list.
* Quality is better than quantity for the audit demo. Make sure we present a polished version of whatever is pesented.
