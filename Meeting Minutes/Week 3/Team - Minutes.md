## Team Meeting - Week 3 - Minutes

### Chatbot imitation
The team did not go ahead with deploying this. That chatbot imitation idea was carefully thought through, and the team decided that the data it would yield would not be useful enough to warrant the effort put in to see it through. The team then decided that the two other methods of data collection (electronic survey and counselling interviews) would prove sufficient.
