## Team Week 8 Meeting

* Team work update
* Peoples thoughts on mass testing
* Main takeaway: people generally like it and find it useful, people have logged feedback
* We need SSL encryption
* Decision made:
  Continue with customisation, but that it is going to be challenging to build the entire interface


### TODO:

- SSL
- Obfuscation & pipeline
- Customisation, plan ahead
- Project poster
