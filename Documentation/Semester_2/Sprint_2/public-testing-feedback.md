* [ ] Amazing perfect exactly what we all need !!! A mobile site would improve accessibility :D
* [x] Amazing job! Well done to the whole team :D
* [x] Hi guys, loving this project!I have attempted to draft up my degree [OXozel4q1K] and while I think I've now got all the courses in there, I have noticed a few functionality issues:- Does not appear to be correctly identifying necessary prerequisites (i.e. level 2000 LAWS or BIOL courses)- Does not increase cap for level 1000 units when adding a double degree- Does not recognise when a course could count towards a specialisation or major (i.e. NEUR3101 is an elective in the Bachelor of Science 'Human Biology' major as well as being a compulsory subject in the 'Neuroscience and Physiology' specialisation)- Incorrectly including all courses as towards the 96 units of a Bachelor of ScienceUsability:- Dragging and dropping makes it difficult to add units
* [x] Super helpful tool! Slow load times for course searches at the moment, recommendations for courses could be improved (recommending me PREP courses, courses for which I do not have the prereqs etc). Otherwise great work guys this has so much potential!!
* [x] It's a great system - biggest issue is ENGN4200 is unable to be dragged into the schedule from the list on the right-hand side for Bachelor of Engineering.
* [x] Pretty good so far but I noticed a few issuesnot all majors/Specialisations are availableThe AI specialisation is only the master option atmThe prerequisite checking isn't robust, I have many courses saying the prerequisites haven't been completed when they havecan't move courses once they've been placed, you have to delete then reselectThe Courses given as part of the BIT degree don't take into consideration alternatives to "compulsory" courses
* [x] Nice and interactive form, though a few things need to be noted.1. Courses run previously should still count in the degree structure, examples are like PHYS2017 which is now obsolete but a very real course when I completed it.2. There are no Engineering majors available from which to select.3. Some courses say you haven't completed the pre-reqs even if they do exist in the degree structure beforehand. (I found it with ENGN2225 and ENGN2226 as an issue).
* [ ] hey, i love it - theres a couple of external courses missing (pols2900 or cbea1900 for example). all the exchange placeholding course codes for my two colleges are here:http://cass.anu.edu.au/form/cass-credit-applicationhttps://www.cbe.anu.edu.au/current-students/policies/ug-exchange-overseas/
* [ ] So useful and it makes so much sense. I love how it says what semester the subject is offered inSuggestions:- allow for colour coding for double degrees- CASS permits you to do subjects from a required course list for the same program from a later year even if that subject is not offered on the list of subjects when you started (e.g. I am studying PPE and I could do a philosophy subject offered for the 2017 cohort, even though it was not offered for my 2015 cohort). It would be great if you could allow for these sort of circumstances
* [ ] Useful! Missing my policy studies degree, though
* [ ] Hi, great website. However, you do not have Policy Studies as a chooseable degree. Thanks!


* [x] 1. Use a favicon for the logo 
    2. Moving courses across semesters should be made possible
    3. Use https-- William Shen
* [x] I showed this off in a tutorial in COMP2120 and they said they wouldn't use it.Didn't automatically bring in courses for 2nd degree in a double degreeSome degrees don't have majors and minors listed in left submenu.Can't overload.Some requirements are wrong in the case of "pick maximum of x units" but are the opposite in this. (pick minimum of x units) Searching add a course sometimes doesn't work
* [x] the major International Business is missingthe courses for the major Asia Pacific Politics dont have the option of previous year plans only 2018, not sure if this is the same for all majorsthanks!!
* [x] because the save/load bar said it saves the plan automatically i didnt think i needed to keep the code and it would keep the plan i made for this account but i reloaded the page and i guess not haha maybe keeping the plan for the account or making the need for actually keeping the code a bit clearer would be goodotherwise tho i love it haha i will definitely be remaking my plan
* [x] It's a great system but many of the prerequisites seem to be broken (demanding MATH1013 be taken before PHYS1101 when concurrent is acceptable and saying STAT1008 has a pre-req at all). Also, the Bachelor of Commerce course selection box is quite unclear about the requirements of the degree, saying only to choose 18 units total. I was also unable to find many of the majors (Management and Mechatronic Systems specifically)This is a wonderful system and I'd love to be able to use it to plan my degree but there's a few things that don't quite work yet. Thanks for working hard to create this platform.
* [x] ENVS2017 - Vietnam Field School isn't available as a course on here.
* [x] Northeast Asian Studies and Anthropology aren't available as majors for Asian Studies
* [x] no BSc
* [x] instead of having remove course as the only option in the grid, make it so you can drag it to other semesters
* [x] missing vietnam field school
* [x] The Bachelor of Languages needs more detail (particularly regarding majors and minors)
* [x] Can't drag and drop the courses between years.. have to delete before adding it again... bit clunky
* [x] Could you please add in all the Bachelor of Arts majors and minors? I can't find environmental studies, geography, etc. Then this planner will be much more useful to me. Thanks!
* [x] You're missing a few majors, such as the Geography major, which also has a minor
* [x] There are some Fenner School intensive courses missing such as the Vietnam field school
* [x] Some compulsory courses auto-input into semesters they aren't/weren't available
* [x] Drop down menus (courses/majors/minors/specialisations) auto-load open at every new search, even if collapsed. It would be nice to not have this happen. But generally this is a really great website!
* [x] Some courses (so far I’ve had PHIL2127 and ENGL2084) claim to be unavailable every year I’ve done my degree, but I’ve done them.
* [x] The degree planner left out some electives that are required in certain degrees. Eg. BINSS requires a completion of 18u from List A which seems to be missing from the website.
* [x] Missing the major for Anthropology and also some first-year courses in arts
* [x] Small note but you have the Maths course requirements for Physics as pre-requisites, whereas they're actually co-requisites (So you can take them simultaneously) Might trip up anyone planning first year physics as it comes up with a 'warning' message
* [ ] I do a double degree, but effectively started one degree in Semester 1 and started the second in Semester 2. If there are separate starting dates for each degree, that may be helpful!
* [ ] The bachelor of psychology (science) doesn't work. Most of the requirements overlap with other categories (i.e. 18 units of 3000 level psych courses considers the compulsory 3000 courses). perhaps a way to delete courses from the collapsible sections on the right? Like "do not consider this course in this requirement"
* [ ] My degree: Bachelor of Policy Studies, is not listed as an existing degree on this site.
* [ ] My degree (Bachelor of Policy Studies) isn't an option. This is probably a backdating issue as it has been changed to another degree (Public Policy) with different requirements.
* [x] Does not work on safari, but does work on chrome on same comp.
* [x] Seems pretty broken - Jay
* [x] you suck
