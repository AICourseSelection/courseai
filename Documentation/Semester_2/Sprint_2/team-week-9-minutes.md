## Standup
* Joseph: Finished obfuscation pipeline, helped Thien migrate db.sqlite3 database to the MySQL database instance running on Google Cloud. Reviewed Thien's user-pages-2 branch.
* Scarlett: Scraped and checked data for all MMS in three colleges. Said the remaining three colleges could be completed within the next two days (approximate).
* Tom: worked on customisation of the degrees/courses/MMS (etc.). Tried to use Django's relational database for storing the customisable data model files. Joseph recommended a different method as the data model is unsuitable for a relational database. Also worked on dragging the course cards between different sessions.
* Thien: Worked on improving the user pages to display full titles. Added a colour legend and set-up the MySQL instance on Google Cloud.
* Yong Wei: Worked on different security layers for the website. Working on HTTPS: should be completed by Friday.
* Manal: Bug fixes, improved course search speed, added missing MMS and restructured the requirements part of data model.

### Other
Scarlett said several of the degrees for each college had incorrect information (on ANU side). Joseph suggested having a re-scrape feature available: the scraped data doesn't need to be perfect. However, need to know about the more specific requirements (such as "2 from this MMS").

## Future Plans
* Joseph, Manal and Tom have internships after week 10.
* Yong Wei said he would be willing to work on the project over the Summer break.
* Thien said he wasn't sure if he wanted to work on the project over the Summer break: wanted to move away from web-development projects.
* Scarlett said she was willing to work ~2-3 hours every two days over the Summer break.

### Research Extra Credit and Project's Future
* Can potentially create a start-up for this project and receive course credit next year (Yong Wei and Scarlett). 
* Will consider what to do with the project after meeting with Accenture (e.g. another TechLauncher project, part of ANU or Accenture).

### Poster and Presentation Slides
* Talk about how we reflected on feedback (improvements to the planner and data etc.)
* Provide comparison between initial product and the final product.
* Slide topics were assigned to individuals.

### Work To complete
Several bugs to fix (listed in GitHub issues).
* Scarlett - look into scraping double degree study options.
* Manal - look into getting basic recommendations available based on the anonymised data.
* Tom - customisation of degrees/courses/mms.
* Joseph - Bug fixing and helping Tom with customisation if necessary or time available.
* Yong Wei - Secure the website with HTTPS.
* Thien - Bug fixing.
* All - complete poster and presentation
