## Week 10 Client Meeting Minutes - Presentation Review

#### Attendance
**Clients:** Bradley, Safeer, Cieran, Emily, ...

**Team:** Joseph, Manal, Thien, Yong Wei, Tom, Scarlett

**Other Accenture Team (Postal Delivery):** Sean, Crystal, Harrison, ...


### ICS presentation
* Bradley recommended having separate people during the demos for smoother transitions
* Should mention more about the feedback, especially with changes made thereafter
* Consider including a video clip of positive comments ("I wish I had this when I started...")
* Think about if too much is being shown in case something goes wrong
* Get back-up videos, screenshots if possible
* Think about getting a script if needed and practice together
* Bradley doesn't think a sprint burndown is necessary, but says it does show progress
* Saf: focus on testing and prototyping if you want to show agile process
* Anticipate questions about agile artefacts (talk about the substitutes used instead)
* Think about shortening the presentation (felt like overtime)
* Bradley and Saf able to attend audit
* Bradley, Saf and Emily able to attend showcase
* Accenture showcase date undetermined

### Postal Delivery Presentation
* In comparison with ICS presentation, demo videos are (more) often used in the commercial sector
* Disadvantage of a video is that the validity of the final product is not as strong (the group should think about what can make it more 'real')
* The 5 minute demo video needs supporting explanation/interaction for better flow (easy to lose people)
* Background music not recommended
* Presentation felt like it was aimed at the clients (people who helped with backlog)
* Anticipate questions about sprint burndown chart (since it had a flat burndown at one point)
