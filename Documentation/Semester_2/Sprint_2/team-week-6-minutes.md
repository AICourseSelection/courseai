#### Audit presentation:

* Every member creates their own slides, and speaks about the work they have done
* The link to the slides has been sent to the Messenger group chat. The common theme to use has been set, and a rough sequence of the order of the slides has been decided too.
* ~1 min per slide and a 5 minute demo takes us to a 20 minute presentation. That leaves 10 minutes for questions.
