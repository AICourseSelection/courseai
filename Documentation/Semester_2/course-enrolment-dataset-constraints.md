Our team was kindly given an anonymised dataset of CECS student enrolment in various courses in the last five years by the Planning and Performance Measurement Division at ANU. We required this dataset to better the recommendations provided by our system. The dataset was handed over to us under some conditions, namely

- The Data cannot be copied to non-ANU cloud resources (use either onedrive, cloudstor, or a VM host provisioned by ITS). 
   -- e.g. Google drive, dropbox, etc. are _not_ ok, do not store the data on any of those services, or any services like those.
 - The Data is not to be shared with, or made available to anyone other than the students in your team (not shadows, client, etc.); AND
 - Any student receiving The Data must have first received a copy of these instructions, and acknowledge by email that they have read these instructions and that they shall adhere to them.
 - The Data can only be stored on a student's personal laptop if that laptop is secure - strong password, encrypted hard drive, etc. Manal Mohania,  is your responsibility to ensure this is the case.
 - You cannot expose this data via a derivative work. If you are going to do a demo, poster, etc., where The Data and/or measurements/features of The Data are exposed, you first require my approval. 
 - Once your Semester 2 2018 TechLauncher project is completed, all copies you make of The Data are to be permanently and irretrievably deleted -- e.g. use the 'shred' utility.
 
 
 
 **As a consequence of this**,
 * We cannot host this dataset onto our Github repository
 * We can only generate good recommendations for CECS students. Although the dataset does contain information about some degrees outside of CECS (mainly through FDDs), they are quite few in number and cannot be relied upon for good recommendations outside of CECS.
 * We cannot generate recommendations on the fly. This is a consequence of the point. We would need pre-compute recommendations for students based on the elective slots they choose.
