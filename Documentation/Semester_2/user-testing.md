**User H** from the Research School of Computer Science stated that the filter didn't provide a clear feedback when selecting filters. "They stay **highlighted in blue when you hover over** each category, clicking it creates a small border around the button and adds to the search bar on the left. However, the feedback does not feel strong enough in a sense that I don't really know if the filter was applied unless I carefully looked around. A suggestion for this is that the filters that were selected should remain highlighted in blue, and for every filter there should be a *"Add to Filter List/Apply Filter"* button as a confirmation instead of subtly being added to the list without clearly notifying the user."

"Without instructions, I wouldn't have known what the **X** really meant."


**User I** from the School of Arts said that "the website was generally easy to use and the layout was alright for its purposes." User I appreciates the Q&A feature, but also suggested that the reset button at the top should be at least somewhat visible at all times as it is currently only visible when users hover over that general area.

**User K** encountered a potential issue. "As long as there is a *green* tick from the *"Your Degree"* tab, I was able to add the same course to all available slots in my degree planner over and over again and eventually submit my degree"

**User K** also suggested adding our university name to the title of the website, but the user interface felt pretty neat and simple and generally easy to use.




**User L** from the Research School of Computer Science mentioned that the drag & drop feature **isn't smooth**; *"If there were no instructions given beforehand, I never would have guessed to drag & drop". Other than that, when I click on a course I was greeted with the course info for that course. However, there was a prerequisite for the course but it **wasn't available** for me to drag & drop under the list of **related courses**"*

**User N** from the School of Physics and Mathematical Sciences said that the navigation felt a little daunting to him.

**User O** raised several findings:
1. "Sometimes I couldn't drag the options in, it just ends up letting me highlight. I don't really know how that happened."
2. "The pop-ups may block some of the cells so u can't drag the units into the cells. "
3. "Sometimes the pop-up suddenly flies to the other side of the screen."

**TODO: Clip to be attached**
