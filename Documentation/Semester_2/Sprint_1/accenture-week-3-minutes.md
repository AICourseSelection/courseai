## Week 3 Client Meeting minutes

Questions asked by clients:

*	Is this website designed for mobile?
*	Does the website consider the course that students fail?   
*	When do you want to let people to try this website? Does ANU know about this website? 
*	Is "human centric" your aim/focus? 

suggestions on the website: 

*	Improve the Q&A system. Make it more interactive. For example, it should be able to respond to "suggest me a minor" or "add COMP3620 to my degree".
*	Improve usability of the website 

Suggestions on presentation:

*	Explain concepts in a more general way.
*	It’s a good sign that all team members to talk in the presentation. 

Suggestions on presentation slide: 

*	Add context to Deployment slide. Guess approximately e.g. how many students enrol. We’ve not created the metrics but this is how we think. Estimate what the cost of running the server would be and based on that determine how much money the ANU could potentially save. 
*	Modify slide “Making ICS valuable”. It is the first time the acronym ICS appears. Either explain it, or remove the reference to it entirely.
*	Is ICS a good name? Sounds like a good B2B name but maybe not a B2C one.  
*	Change the last lecture slide. Change title to “Thanks for listening.” Otherwise, it doesn’t look like a final slide.    
*	How long does one lecture slide take? Half a min per slide. 
*	Project Management: MAKE THIS REALLY CLEAR. What challenges /problems we met at the START of the deck. Create a slide for what we learnt from the last semester and what our solutions are. What went well in the last semester? What went wrong in the last semester? What new ideas did you come up with to combat the flaws?
*	Come up with user stories when doing the voiceover on the video.
