## Week 3 Client Meeting minutes

#### Questions asked by clients:

*	Is this website designed for mobile?
*	Does the website consider students failing a course/courses?   
*	When do you want to let people try this website? Does ANU know about this website? 
*	Is "human centric" your aim/focus? 

#### Suggestions on the website: 

*	Q&A system improvement: make it more interactive. For example, (visually) respond to "suggest me a minor" or "add COMP3620 to my degree".
*	Improve usability through user testing; get "testers" with little background knowledge to interact with the website.

#### Suggestions on presentation:

*	Explain concepts in a more general way - limit technical language/knowledge (e.g. acronyms).
*	Having all team members talk during the presentation shows involvement. 

#### Suggestions on presentation slide: 

*	Add context to Deployment slide. 
    * Assume how many students enrol or will use the web app. 
    * Show the thought behind decisions even if they're impossible at the time (e.g. web hosting metrics). 
    * Estimate total cost of hosting website to determine benefits from hosting with ANU servers. 
*	Modify slide “Making ICS valuable” since it's the first time the acronym "ICS" appears. Explain it, or remove it entirely.
*	Is ICS a good name? Sounds like a good B2B name but maybe not a B2C one.  
*	Change title of last lecture slide to “Thanks for listening”: it doesn’t look like a final slide.    
*	How long does one lecture slide take? Half a min per slide. 
*	Project Management: MAKE THIS **REALLY** CLEAR. 
    * What challenges/problems were met at the START of the deck. 
    * Create a slide for what we learnt from last semester and our solutions. 
    * What went well/wrong in the last semester? What new ideas did you come up with to combat the flaws?
*	Come up with user stories when doing the voiceover on the demo video.

#### Presentation slide: 

*	Tom: YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT "SMART" STANDS FOR!! 
*	Manal: key focus slide
*	Scarlett: Achieved so far this semester
