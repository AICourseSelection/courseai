## Tutorial 3 meeting minutes

* Introduction of each team member and the project as a whole
* Keep in touch with Kerry- she is quite knowledgable about AI
* Peter is going to review and/or reevaluate the feedback from the first audit
* Mention the person responsible for a task when taking minutes. If none can be identified at that moment, create a Trello card and mention its ID.
* Trello cards better suited to smaller tasks. If we still want to go with cards for bigger tasks, show Peter an example and explain to him how it works.
