## Refactoring

### 4 MODULES

* User Login: Scarlett's job
* Search: Manal's job
* Degree: Tom's job
* ~~Degree Builder~~: Contains Joseph's code. Need to place it elsewhere
* Recommendation: Manal -> Decouple recommendations from the search module



ElasticSearch stores

* MMS
* Courses
* Recommendations

Do we need more than that? Should we remove stuff? Manal's job

Move away from Ontology because too hard to deploy. Tom's job

Degree plans are handwritten JSONs. These need to be either automated (by scraping P&C and writing a parser), or somehow get hold of the SASS API. Tom's job
