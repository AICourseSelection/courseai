* Create small, incremental tasks on Trello.
* Peter: Prefers 2 or 3 people speak during the presentation and the whole team should be ready to answer questions. If you go for multiple speakers, the presentation should be well rehearsed.
* Shadow team
	* Going to use Trello actively. 
	* Decided to go for fewer speakers during the presentation. Peter is happy with it.
	* They do not have to wait for client meetings if they face a problem. Their client is responsive over feedback.
	* They are going to create a decision log. Peter thinks it's a good idea to create one because it becomes easy to discuss their progress with the clients. 
	* Rehearsing presentations is not that important. All the content is available to the shadow team (us).
