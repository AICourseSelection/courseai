# User Testing Document

**User C** from the College of Business and Economics likes the drag and drop feature, in addition to the checks for course availablity for his desired semester. However, "I can't drag and drop to another unit and swap with it." "The system is letting me repeat the same course over and over again". This is due to a broken commit that was pushed to the repository which was also pushed to the live server. Furthermore, the unsupervised testing shown that the hidden "Reset/Clear" button is a relatively poor design choice as **User C** said that he spent a few minutes trying to find out how to clear the table but ended up not finding it. "I tried using the website on a mobile at first but I couldn't add any courses".

**User G** stated that the website "looks absolutely impressive, but there should be more colors!!" 

**User HH** said that "The input for starting year should just be a selection box, some non-native English speakers like myself may be confused otherwise." "The overall experience is really simple and easy, but the layouts should be revised because sometimes the objects can be all over the place, ocassionally covering the part of the planner itself." "Not bad, ANU should've made something like this lol."

**User HH** from the Research School of Computer Science stated that the filter didn't provide a clear feedback when selecting filters. "They stay **highlighted in blue when you hover over** each category, clicking it creates a small border around the button and adds to the search bar on the left. However, the feedback does not feel strong enough in a sense that I don't really know if the filter was applied unless I carefully looked around. A suggestion for this is that the filters that were selected should remain highlighted in blue, and for every filter there should be a *"Add to Filter List/Apply Filter"* button as a confirmation instead of subtly being added to the list without clearly notifying the user."

"Without instructions, I wouldn't have known what the **X** really meant."


**User I** from the School of Arts said that "the website was generally easy to use and the layout was alright for its purposes." User I appreciates the Q&A feature, but also suggested that the reset button at the top should be at least somewhat visible at all times as it is currently only visible when users hover over that general area.

**User K** encountered a potential issue. "As long as there is a *green* tick from the *"Your Degree"* tab, I was able to add the same course to all available slots in my degree planner over and over again and eventually submit my degree"

**User K** also suggested adding our university name to the title of the website, but the user interface felt pretty neat and simple and generally easy to use.

**User L** from the Research School of Computer Science mentioned that the drag & drop feature **isn't smooth**; *"If there were no instructions given beforehand, I never would have guessed to drag & drop". Other than that, when I click on a course I was greeted with the course info for that course. However, there was a prerequisite for the course but it **wasn't available** for me to drag & drop under the list of **related courses**"*

**User LL** from the School of Physics and Mathematical Sciences said that her first impression was that the website is pretty easy to use and intuitive. However, "when I drag a course into a cell, that cell should be colored. Courses from differing categories should also be color coded." Color coding is on our backlog but may probably be pushed up the priority queue if more users request for it. Moreover, she suggested that there should be an option to download the finished planner.

**User M** described that the website looks really bland, "there are too much empty spaces, especially the homepage." "The frontpage should include 'ANU' since this is made for our university." "The Ask a Question feature is really cool, but it feels quite intrusive if my browser window is small, if I click on the X it simply disappears, but what if I need to use it later?" This issue was also raised by our clients so it's clear that changes to this can and should be made as soon as possible. "I really like the fact that clicking on a course reveals more details about it as well as related courses though it seemed that the related course section is not entirely accurate which I assume  will improve over time."

**User N** from the School of Physics and Mathematical Sciences said that the navigation felt a little daunting to him.

**User O** raised several findings:
1. "Sometimes I couldn't drag the options in, it just ends up letting me highlight. I don't really know how that happened."
2. "The pop-ups may block some of the cells so u can't drag the units into the cells. "
3. "Sometimes the pop-up suddenly flies to the other side of the screen."

**User OO** absolutely loves the website, "I wish something like this was available when I first started my undergrad degree. It would've made my life so much easier back then." He is a Masters of Computing student and was notified that Postgrad degrees are not available in the current version. He mentioned that he was interested in the "Ask a Question" feature and is keen to see how great can it become when the service is officially released to public. "I'm looking forward to the Postgrad integration, and maybe even a saving/downloading option at some point in the near future."
