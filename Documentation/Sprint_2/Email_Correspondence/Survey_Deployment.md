## Email Correspondence with ANUSA, PPM and Evaluations

#### Objective: Arrange to have our survey deployed to a random, reasonably-sized sample of ANU undergraduate students. 

Jack  communicated with ANUSA and PPM on our teamâ€™s behalf to deploy our survey in multiple channels, one of which being the ANU platform such as ANUSA, CSSA to distribute the survey to undergraduates. 

With the following emails shown as evidence, it was originally thought that oursurvey was almost approved to be deployed to undergraduates. However, while the Evaluations team had approved the survey for deployment under certain conditions, ANUSA did not approve our survey, under the assumption that they receive too many requests and thus decline them all in order to not bias any surveys.

It was concluded that our team would not be able to deploy the survey under both associations without making unnecessary adjustments.
