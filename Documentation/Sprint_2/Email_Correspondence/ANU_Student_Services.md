**Subject:** Information on Course Selection Counselling

Dear Student Services,

My name is Joseph Meltzer, a Computer Science student working in a team of six on an AI project to improve course selection and scheduling for ANU students.  We are working with the technology company Accenture and are aiming to produce by the end of this semester an innovative and interactive AI course selection and scheduling system to work alongside Programs and Courses.At the moment we are trying to form an understanding of what major problems students are experiencing with *course selection*, *scheduling*, and *enrolment*. 

We would like to gather information on new and current undergraduate students would like to see from such a system. One method we have considered of gathering this data is to talk to advisors who currently provide students with this service in person. We would like to know if it would be possible for Student Services to assist us in any of the following ways:

1. We interview counsellors about what students most frequently ask them to do with course selection, scheduling, and/or enrolment. 

2. Allow us to observe a few counselling sessions given permission from the counsellors and/orthe students. 

3. Allow us to listen to or keep audio recordings of counselling sessions. 

We would greatly appreciate it if the ANU was to help us complete one of the above tasks, or suggest an alternative route to obtaining the information. We are also sending out an electronic survey to some students, but any of the above information would be of greater use to us.

We believe that our project can help students who are struggling with degree planning and course scheduling to be more informed and efficient in doing so. However, to do this properly, we must ensure that we design our product to fit the needs of the students themselves. We are doing this project through ANUâ€™s TechLaunche rinitiative, and it can be read about here: <https://github.com/AICourseSelection/courseai>.

Thank you,
Joseph Meltzer
