# User Testing

### Suggestions implemented:

* Highlight/border when dragging to indicate when it will be successful
* Button to clear all courses
* Extra space between semesters of different years
* Allow dragging when prereqs not met but show awarning
* Flag the entire plan if one course was added after ignoring a warning

### Not implemented yet

* Option to delete major’s courses when deleting a major
* The meaning of the ‘X’ on compulsory courses is not obvious (need to discuss how to fix this)
* Avoid overlapping of popovers (high effort, low reward)
* User submitted reviews of courses (not in scope)
