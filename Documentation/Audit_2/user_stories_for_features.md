## User Stories for Features

For our project, we had three innovative features for the AI course selection and scheduling. The user stories of those features are shown below. 

### Intelligent course recommendation

As an undergraduate student, I want to search for courses related to a few key words so that I can find a course easier and quicker.

### AI enhanced course search system

As an undergraduate student, I can search for useful, efficient information when searching for courses, so that I can understand a course easier than the current search system(s).

* It can find courses based off searches for course descriptions.
* It can suggest courses based off course queries.

### Interactive degree planner

As an undergraduate, I want to personalise my study plan with an interactive degree planner, so that I can easily organise my studies with other parts of my lifestyle.

* It needs to be fully customisable, only restricted by course requirements.
* I want to have an easy, simple interface to perform necessary tasks to my study plan.
