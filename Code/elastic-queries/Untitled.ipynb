The framework focuses on institutional environments (such as legal systems) in different countries and their impacts on corporate behaviour. We also present empirical evidence that such a framework might not necessarily explain the recent developments in China and India. Two of the important features in Asian capital markets, which contrast those of capital markets in UK-US, are the roles played by the State and closely tied families, which we will discuss in detail.

Through the framework of comparative politics, it will take on several major themes including democratization, identity politics, corruption, and development. In ordinary language, comparisons are often implicit, and arguments are based on weak evidence or poor logic. In this course, students will master not just facts and figures, but a sophisticated approach to analysis that can be used in the study of politics not just of countries in Asia but around the world. The twin thrusts of this course will be learning how to evaluate key concepts in political science (e.g. democracy), and learning how to draw valid causal inferences from comparative political analysis. Students will thus develop the skills to critically evaluate causal claims made in academic, policy, and journalistic writing. The course will be structured by first introducing students to key theoretical and comparative works on selected themes and then applying the approaches comparatively across and within countries in Asia.

The course also aims to further develop students' research and essay writing skills. With a significant guided research and writing component, it is a course that is suitable preparation for students who are planning to undertake the research paper for Honours. Students will be required to write a research essay and will be encouraged to choose a topic relating to their own interests in Australian legal history.The proposed topics for class discussion include sovereignty, colonial rule, the reception of English law and the early colonial courts. This will be followed by consideration of the journey from repugnance to independence including examination of uniquely Australian colonial legislation and related laws of the nineteenth century. Consideration of the limitations of colonial law when responding to frontier violence and rebellion during this period will enable examination, from a legal perspective, of some focal events such as the Rum Rebellion, the Myall Creek massacre, the Eureka stockade and the trial of Ned Kelly. The course will also examine early Australian environmental laws and natural resource use that have shaped the landscape and the exploitation of the natural environment of the Australian continent. Moving towards the twentieth century, the course will consider pathways to Federation and influences that shaped our Constitution and legal institutions. This will be followed by examination of the Australian High Court in the twentieth century, including patterns of Australian doctrinal development, deference to the English courts, the role of the Privy Council and the influence of a selection of significant English cases on Australian law. The Australian notion of the separation of powers will be examined in an historical context.

For Buddhists, enlightenment is attained by gaining insight into the nature of reality (metaphysics), knowledge (epistemology), language (philosophy of language) and our ways of living (ethics). These insights are acquired, in large part, by subjecting our beliefs to rational scrutiny. In this course, we critically examine some of the core issues in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of language and ethics that are elaborated by Buddhist philosophers. The course proceeds by analyzing some core texts of Buddhist philosophy (in English translation) together with some secondary literature. We study Buddhist philosophy not as an item of historical and cultural interest but as an attempt to ascertain how much truth lies in this system of thought. Once we gain an understanding of the views expounded by Buddhist philosophers, we will subject their doctrines to rational scrutiny in the hope of attaining some enlightenment for ourselves.\", \"outcome\": \"Demonstrate a general knowledge of some major schools, figures and issues in the Buddhist tradition of PhilosophyExpress and expound views and pre-suppositions of Buddhist philosophers clearly and lucidly;Understand and critically evaluate theories, arguments and presuppositions of Buddhist philosophers\", \"area\": \"PHIL\", \"prereq_text\": \"6 units of Philosophy (PHIL) courses, or with permission of the course convenor.\", \"pre_req_cnf\":[]}\n",

Why was calligraphy so attractive to him? Why has the art of writing lines become so appealing? Chinese calligraphy certainly is a âsecond to noneâ art form, and is without doubt the most important form of art in Chinese history. In daily and academic lives, Chinese words/characters are not only for embodying meaning, but also for various purposes of cultural expression, such as writing, artistic performing, religion, aesthetics and philosophy, social life and âtempering personalityâ. In fact, it is rare to find any Chinese literati without the ability to function in this art in earlier historical periods. Therefore, it can be said that Chinese culture truly is a filled âculture of words.âAdditionally, Chinese history is closely reflected in the long development of Chinese characters, which has evolved into different styles. It creates a set of delicate and profound Chinese aesthetic theory, which echoes Chinese art theory and philosophy, such as âthe vacuity vs. substanceâ (or âthe empty/illusionaryâ vs. âthe real/full/solid/the substanceâ), and loose vs. density, or the dialectical relationship betweenâblackness vs. whitenessâ (or the black line vs. the white space). Chinese calligraphy can also be said to be a unique abstract art through linear expression. In Taiwan, Mainland China, Korea and Japan, postgraduate degrees in calligraphy are offered in Chinese or art departments. Learning and knowing Chinese calligraphy as such is necessary for all Chinese studies, especially those wanting an advanced understanding about Chinese history and culture.This course provides students with a general, yet profound, introduction to Chinese calligraphy. Through practice and knowledge acquirement, such as holding a brush, writing and knowing the knowledge of the four treasuresâ, students can experience this ancient Chinese art and cultivate an interest for Chinese culture. As simplified Chinese has gradually become a dominant trend nowadays, traditional Chinese nevertheless is still a genuine access point to Chinese culture and Sinology in terms of its history, aesthetics and philosophy and literati circles. Simplified vs. traditional characters also reflects in different Chinese societies, namely Mainland China and Taiwan. Students will learn how to write and appreciate this âart of lines,â accompanied by the knowledge of its history and theory.\", \"outcome\": \"nan\", \"area\": \"ASIA\", \"prereq_text\": \"To enrol in this course you must have successfully completed at least 24 units of university courses.\", \"pre_req_cnf\":[]}\n",

Even after the collapse of the major historic imperial powers during the second half of the twentieth century, the legacies of those empires continue to shape contemporary life. And historians and political analysts still talk in terms of - and seek to redefine - imperialism in reference to present polities.Â Â China is central to such discourses on imperial power: it offers a particularly rich body of historical evidence for the practice of empire. This introductory course will therefore assess that evidence and survey the great drama of Chinese attempts to bring under single control and preserve the unity of its vast territories, so varied ethnically, culturally, and geographically. It will take in the full sweep of China's imperial past: it will start in the third century BC, when the foundations of the imperial system were consolidated; it will reach into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when encounters with Western powers forced a radical reappraisal of the Chinese imperial system. Dividing this broad chronological scope into three periods - early China, medieval China, and late imperial China - it will offer a sense of larger changes and continuities over time. Within each period, it will bring into sharp focus the social, cultural, and political arenas in which Chinese empire was developed and maintained.\", \"outcome\": \"nan\", \"area\": \"ASIA\", \"prereq_text\": \"To enrol in this course you must have successfully completed at least 24 units of university courses.

The course provides a select group of undergraduate students in CBE with the opportunity to work in a small cross-disciplinary team setting and solve a business problem presented by a live business client. The academic component of the course is comprised of a series of master classes delivered by academic experts and industry professionals. Under the supervision of the course convenor and support of a designated industry mentor, students will apply their theoretical knowledge into practice by working on innovative solutions that address the specified business issue from the live business client, who is a multinational corporation located in Australia or overseas. The CBE Special Industry Project course facilitates undergraduate students' development of professional skills important for their job market readiness.\", \"outcome\": \"nan\", \"area\": \"CBEA\", \"prereq_text\": \"To be eligible for the CBE Special Industry Project course, students must be a current undergraduate student enrolled in a CBE academic program (including single or double degrees).
