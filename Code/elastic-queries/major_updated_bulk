As a field of study anthropology is uniquely placed to interpret the widest range of contemporary social phenomena - from migration to religious fundamentalism, online communities and new social movements, contemporary indigenous cultural expression and identity politics, consumption and commodification, and many changing forms of social relationships. The School of Archaeology and Anthropology offers a diverse range of undergraduate courses which cover these themes and more.The discipline's distinctive methodology\u2014long-term ethnographic fieldwork\u2014provides anthropologists with finely grained and in-depth understandings of complex social phenomena.

As a field of study anthropology is uniquely placed to interpret the widest range of contemporary social phenomena - from migration to religious fundamentalism, online communities and new social movements, contemporary indigenous cultural expression and identity politics, consumption and commodification, and many changing forms of social relationships. The School of Archaeology and Anthropology offers a diverse range of undergraduate courses which cover these themes and more.The discipline's distinctive methodology, long-term ethnographic fieldwork, provides anthropologists with finely grained and in-depth understandings of complex social phenomena. With a commitment to a comparative and holistic framework, anthropologists' treatment of cultural diversity provides insights into the different ways people comprehend their place in the world and relationships to each other, as well as new ways for us to think about our own relationships and society. It is an ideal foundation for a contemporary liberal-arts degree. Students of non-English languages can find anthropology especially useful. Learning outcomes familiarity with the major dimensions of analysis of societies and cultures (e.g., gender, religion, personhood, identity, violence, emotion, state, nation, globalisation) familiarity with directed as well as unintended processes of change (e.g., culture and development, applied anthropology) familiarity with the interrelation of technique and theory in the recording and describing of cultures (e.g., film); and familiarity with the intersection of bio-social and material dimensions of social life","title": "Anthropology"}}}

In this major, you will learn to understand and use a wide array of statistical modelling techniques that will empower you to make sense of data and offer insights to a wide variety of disciplines, from archaeology to zoology and almost everything in between. If there are data, there is a need for applied statistics. Learning Outcomes1. Exhibit a working knowledge of the statistical computing package R.2. Apply statistical survey sampling techniques to design a routine sample survey.3. Apply basic principles in the design of simple experiments.4. Fit simple and multiple linear regression models and interpret model parameters.5. Carry out model selection in a multiple linear regression modelling context.6. Communicate the role of generalized linear modelling techniques (GLMs) in modern applied statistics and implement GLM methodology.7. Effectively communicate statistical analyses graphically, numerically and in written reports8. Understand basic multivariate analyses techniques and the bootstrap.9. Understand and describe statistical models of transfer between multiple states, including processes with single or multiple decrements, and derive relationships between probabilities of transfer and transition intensities10.

It is also concerned with the non-human primates, and with current debates on the biological bases of human social behaviour. The subject thus encompasses what used to be called physical anthropology, as well as primatology, palaeoanthropology and human population biology, including human genetics and the study of human health, nutrition, growth, demography and ecological adaptation, viewed comparatively and synthetically.The pass degree courses are planned, not to provide specialised professional training, but to present students with an overall understanding of biological anthropology and its main sub-fields. Honours courses offer more specialist training and examine in more depth the discipline's theoretical basis. Students considering the possibility of entering careers as professional biological anthropologists should plan their courses with a view to taking the degree with Honours. Specific preparation for honours work begins in third year.","title": "Biological Anthropology"}}}

Its key purpose is to investigate how digital methodologies can be used to enhance and transform research in the Arts and Social Sciences.

Learning OutcomesStudents who complete this major will have the skills and knowledge to: Understand the connections between human culture, institutions and policies and environmental systems and change. Critically assess the relationships between human cultures and societies, the institutions, economic and political paradigms that characterise them, and the impacts on the natural environment. Apply multi- and interdisciplinary approaches to tackling complex problems in a variety of contexts (e.g. climate change mitigation and adaptation, sustainability in business and industry, regional planning, land care, public participation, and cultural heritage).

All courses, right from the Introductory level, emphasise the importance of culture, history, politics and society. The aim is to have students gain fluency in French together with a background knowledge of France, both in its European and overseas context, particularly the Pacific. To this end, we use a variety of material drawn from written, audio-visual and electronic sources. We encourage students to study for part of their degree at a French-speaking university, once they are proficient enough. Honours students normally spend a semester abroad. We have exchange agreements with several French universities, including in the Pacific (Noumea, Tahiti), with Canada: (McGill University, Montreal; the bilingual University of Ottawa) and with Switzerland (University of Geneva). Scholarships are available on a competitive basis. Students beginning this major at introductory level follow a different pathway to complete the major.Language level placement tests are held prior to commencement. IMPORTANT NOTE:Due to structural changes in the undergraduate program rules in 2012, the courses that make up the new 2012 majors may be different to the pre-2012 majors, and therefore some courses cannot be counted between majors. Students are advised to contact the CASS Student Office if they are unsure about their Majors. Learning outcomesOn successful completion of the French Language & Culture Major all students will have gained general fluency in oral and written expression as well as in aural and reading comprehension. Fluency covers expression in different registers from everyday language use to academic language. Students will have developed the ability to express themselves orally and in writing in different genres. Students will have gained substantial knowledge on key aspects of French culture, history, politics and society. They will be able to interpret critically French and Francophone literary texts, movies and visual-media Students will have gained intercultural awareness. They will be able to critically compare and reflect on cross-cultural differences between Francophone and Australian cultures and/or their native culture.At the end of a French Language & Culture Major students should be able to achieve the B1 or B2 level of the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) depending on their results. Exceptional students with or without extensive prior knowledge of French before they start their major could achieve the C1 level.","title": "French Language and Culture"},"2018": {"requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"type": "minimum","units": 12,"courses": [[{"code": "FREN3006","title": "Intermediate French I"}],[{"code": "FREN3007","title": "Intermediate French II"}],[{"code": "FREN3010","title": "Advanced French I"}],[{"code": "FREN3011","title": "Advanced French II"}]]},{"type": "maximum","units": 36,"courses": [[{"code": "FREN1003","title": "Introductory French I"}],[{"code": "FREN1004","title": "Introductory French II"}],[{"code": "FREN2021","title": "Selected Topics in French Studies"}],[{"code": "FREN2024","title": "Continuing French I"}],[{"code": "FREN2025","title": "Continuing French II"}],[{"code": "FREN3012","title": "Global Paris: Culture, History and Identity in the French Capital"}],[{"code": "FREN3107","title": "Current Affairs and the French Press (Advanced)"}],[{"code": "FREN3108","title": "Imagining the French Empire: French Colonialism on Film"}],[{"code": "FREN3515","title": "The sounds of French: phonetics and pronunciation"}]]},{"type": "maximum","units": 6,"courses": [[{"code": "LANG3001","title": "Translation across Languages: the translation of literary texts"}],[{"code": "LANG3002","title": "Translation across Languages: specialised material"}],[{"code": "LANG3003","title": "European Narrative"}],[{"code": "LANG3005","title": "Language and Identity in a European Context"}]]},{"type": "maximum","units": 6,"courses": [[{"code": "ARTH2080","title": "Art and Visual Culture of the Long Eighteenth Century, 1660-1815"}],[{"code": "ARTH2081","title": "Art of the European Courts, 1500-1815"}],[{"code": "HIST2223","title": "The French Revolution and Napoleon"}],[{"code": "PHIL2059","title": "Love Death and Freedom (20th Century French Phenomenology)"}],[{"code": "FREN2021","title": "Selected Topics in French Studies"}]]}]},"learning_outcomes": "Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: \n1. communicate proficiently and confidently in French\n2. identify the structure and uses of French\n3. demonstrate an understanding of the societies and cultures of France and the Francophone world, and their socio-historical contexts\n4. construct a schema of the connections between France and its geographical, social and cultural origins\n5. recognise the importance of intercultural communication. \n Additional Information FREN2021 and FREN3008 may be taken more than once if Topic is different Relevant Degrees 6.

to understand, pronounce and speak standard French and to read and write French as it appears in newspapers, magazines, media, cinema and literature. All courses, right from the Introductory level, emphasise the importance of culture, history, politics and society. The aim is to have students gain fluency in French and develop their knowledge of France, both in its European and global contexts (e.g., Africa, Asia, North America and the Pacific). To this end, we use a variety of material drawn from written, audio-visual and electronic sources. We encourage students to study for part of their degree at a French-speaking university, once they are proficient enough. It is standard practice for Honours students to spend a semester abroad. The ANU has exchange agreements with universities across the French-speaking world: France: several universities in metropolitan France; also in the French Pacific (Noumea, Tahiti); Canada: universities in Quebec (McGill University; Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al) and the bilingual Universit\u00e9 d'Ottawa; Switzerland (Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve). Scholarships are available on a competitive basis. The pathways to the French Language and Culture Major depend on the entry level. These pathways are listed below. Language level placement tests are held prior to commencement for all students having had previous exposure to the language.

This major aims to provide that level of understanding by exploring human evolutionary history, a story spanning the last seven million years, and its relevance for humans today.

Language learning is integrated with the development of cultural awareness, and students have the opportunity to explore such areas as Italian sociolinguistics, cinema, music, gender studies, postcolonial, migration and women's literature. Students are encouraged to spend a semester studying abroad, taking advantage of exchange agreements with partner universities in Italy. Students with existing knowledge of Italian can begin at a more advanced level, and the exact sequence of courses depends on the level at which the student begins the major. IMPORTANT NOTE:Due to structural changes in the undergraduate program rules in 2012, the courses that make up the new 2012 majors may be different to the pre-2012 majors, and therefore some courses cannot be counted between majors. Students are advised to contact the CASS Student Office if they are unsure about their Majors. Learning outcomesUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:1. communicate proficiently and confidently in Italian2. identify the structure and uses of Italian3. demonstrate an understanding of the cultural and linguistics aspects of Italian language and societies and their socio-historical context4. construct a schema of the connections between the Italian language and its geographical, social and cultural origins5. recognise the importance of intercultural communication.","title": "Italian Language and Culture"}}}

Linguists study languages from various points of view, including structure, acquisition, evolution and function in society. There are special branches of linguistics devoted to different aspects of languages, such as their sounds (phonetics and phonology), sentence structures (syntax), conversation and text structures (discourse), and the meanings they convey (semantics).Of the courses taught by the Program, some are devoted to the theory and methods, while others deal with a variety of applied issues, such as language policy and language teaching.In these courses, students are exposed to data from a wide variety of languages and may do detailed work on a number of different languages and language families. Thorough training is given in linguistic theory and its application to a variety of empirical problems. Attention is also directed to research methods, the application of linguistics to language teaching, language planning and socio-linguistic issues. IMPORTANT NOTE:Due to structural changes in the undergraduate program rules in 2012, the courses that make up the new 2012 majors may be different to the pre-2012 majors, and therefore some courses cannot be counted between majors. Students are advised to contact the CASS Student Office if they are unsure about their Majors.

Linguists study languages from various points of view, including structure, acquisition, evolution and function in society. There are special branches of linguistics devoted to different aspects of languages, such as their sounds (phonetics and phonology), sentence structures (syntax), conversation and text structures (discourse), and the meanings they convey (semantics).Of the courses taught by the Program, some are devoted to the theory and methods, while others deal with a variety of applied issues, such as language policy and language teaching.In these courses, students are exposed to data from a wide variety of languages and may do detailed work on a number of different languages and language families. Thorough training is given in linguistic theory and its application to a variety of empirical problems. Attention is also directed to research methods, the application of linguistics to language teaching, language planning and socio-linguistic issues. IMPORTANT NOTE:Due to structural changes in the undergraduate program rules in 2012, the courses that make up the new 2012 majors may be different to the pre-2012 majors, and therefore some courses cannot be counted between majors. Students are advised to contact the CASS Student Office if they are unsure about their Majors. Learning outcomesGraduates within the Linguistics Major will have the knowledge and skills to:demonstrate an understanding of the nature of the structures found in all human languagesdemonstrate an understanding of how people use languages to communicate, and of the role of language in human societydescribe the most important sorts of variation found in human languagesmake in-depth analysis in at least one linguistic sub-structureevaluate popular beliefs and arguments concerning language use and language diversity","title": "Linguistics"},"2017": {"requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "LING1001","title": "Introduction to the Study of Language"}]]},{"type": "maximum","units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "AUST1001","title": "Learning an Indigenous Australian Language"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "CLAS1001","title": "Traditional Grammar"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING1002","title": "Language and Society"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "PHIL1005","title": "Logic and Critical Thinking"}]]},{"type": "minimum","units": 12,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2003","title": "Introduction to Syntax"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2008","title": "Semantics"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2010","title": "Sounds of the World's Languages: Phonetics and Phonology"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2020","title": "Structure of English"}]]},{"type": "maximum","units": 18,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "ASIA2001","title": "Language in Asia"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "ASIA2103","title": "Language in Asia (L)"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "ASIA2308","title": "Linguistic Histories in Asia and the Pacific"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "AUST2008","title": "Learning an Indigenous Australian language 2"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "COMP2620","title": "Logic"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "GERM2048","title": "Spoken Interaction in German: Theory and Practice"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "HUMN2001","title": "Digital Humanities: Theories and Projects"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "INDN2101","title": "The Shape of Indonesian: Its Structure and Development"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "JPNS2024","title": "Japanese Grammar and Expressions"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2005","title": "Language Change and Linguistic Reconstruction"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2013","title": "Teaching Languages"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2015","title": "Language, Culture, Translation"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2016","title": "Language in Indigenous Australia"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2017","title": "Chinese Linguistics"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2018","title": "Languages in Contact"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2021","title": "Cross Cultural Communication"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2022","title": "Language Policy and Language Politics"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2023","title": "Dictionaries and Dictionary-Making"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2027","title": "Language and Society in Latin America"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2028","title": "Japanese Linguistics"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2029","title": "Assessing Language"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2101","title": "Second Language Acquisition"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2103","title": "Language, Power, and Identity"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2104","title": "The History of the English Language"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2105","title": "Language and the law: introduction to forensic linguistics"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2106","title": "Language and Social Interaction"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "LING2107","title": "Academic English"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "PASI2010","title": "Talking the Pacific: Melanesian pidgins and creoles in social context"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "PHIL2016","title": "Philosophy of Language"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "PHIL2080","title": "Logic"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "PHIL2121","title": "Philosophical Logic"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SPAN2601","title": "The Sounds of Spanish"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SPAN2602","title": "The Structure of Spanish"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SPAN2603","title": "History of the Spanish language.

MATH1013 or MATH1115; MATH1014 or MATH1116; COMP1100 or COMP1130 or COMP1730; and either STAT1003 or STAT1008 By its nature, mathematical modelling is a general topic. For the non-compulsory courses in the major, we recommend that students choose two courses that fit into one of the groups listed below. The three different groupings allow students to emphasis different aspects depending on their interests. Analytical Mathematical Modelling 11. MATH3116: Applied Analysis 1 Honours: Metric Spaces and Applications or MATH2320: Analysis 1 Honours: Metric Spaces and Applications, plus one of the following courses\n12. MATH3512: Matrix Computations or MATH3514: Numerical Optimisation\n13. MATH3320: Analysis 2 Honours: Topology, Lebesgue Integration and Hilbert Spaces\n Computational Mathematical Modelling 14. MATH3512: Matrix Computations or MATH3514: Numerical Optimisation , plus one of the following courses\n15. COMP3320: High Performance Scientific Computing.\n16. COMP2130: Software Analysis and Design.\n17. COMP3420: Advanced Databases and Data Mining.\n18. COMP3600: Algorithms.\n Applied Mathematical Modelling Any two of the following courses (one of which must be a third year course) 19. MATH3133: Environmental Mathematics.\n20. MATH3512: Matrix Computations.\n21. MATH3514: Numerical Optimization.\n22. MATH3062: Fractal Geometry and Chaotic Dynamics.\n23. MATH2307: Bioinformatics and Biological Modelling.\n24. MATH3029: Probability Modelling with Applications.\n25. STAT3015: Generalised Linear Modelling.\n26. STAT3008: Applied Statistics.\n27. STAT2008: Regression Modelling.\n28. STAT2001: Introductory Mathematical Statistics.\n29. STAT3004: Stochastic Modelling\n The courses in Analytical Mathematical Modelling focus more on the theoretical aspects of modelling. Students considering honours in mathematics with a major in Mathematical Modelling should take the courses in Analytical Mathematical Modelling, along with any other mathematics HPC courses of interest. Students interested in further research in a quantitative discipline may also benefit from the analytical skills developed in this major. The courses in Computational Mathematical Modelling focus more on scientific computing. They are intended for students with both a strong interest in mathematics and computing. Students interested in doing honours in Computational Science should take the courses in Computational Mathematical Modelling. Students interested in further research in a discipline with a strong computational component, such as astronomy, can benefit from the technical skills developed in this major. The courses in Applied Mathematical Modelling are aimed at students interested in developing their skills in building and interpreting models. This includes students whose primary interest is in an application area, such as physics or economics, but wants a better understanding of the models used in their discipline. It also includes students who have more of a professional or vocational focus. Students may be interested in taking this particular grouping of courses with more qualitative courses that better help them communicate their analysis to a wider audience. Students should be aware of the need to complete the pre-requisites for the level 2000 and 3000 courses. In particular, note that some of the courses are HPC courses. Also, to undertake later year computer science courses it is generally required to undertake 12 units of 2000-level COMP courses. Students should seek further course advice from the academic convener of this Mathematical Modelling major. Relevant Degrees 30.  Bachelor of Languages (BLANG) \n31.  Bachelor of Science (BSC) \n32.

As our understanding of these models improves, the complexity of the types of questions being asked increases. The objective of this major is to train students in techniques of model development, use and assessment.A key requirement for future scientists, industry leaders, resource managers, and policy makers is an ability to build and evaluate models and/or interpret model outputs. Career opportunities for graduates extend into every part of society, including: research (e.g. CSIRO, Universities); public sector (e.g. Bureau of Meteorology, Murray Darling Basin Authority, state government agencies); and private sector (e.g. engineering, finance).Students are advised to take this major in conjunction with a major or minor from an application area. For example, students may choose to complement this major with a quantitative applications major or minor consisting of courses from areas such as: physics; earth and environmental science; global change science; climate science and policy; environmental geoscience; geophysics; quantitative finance; or mathematical finance.Coupled with a detailed disciplinary base, this major will provide students with the necessary skills to tackle the problems facing tomorrow's society.","title": "Mathematical Modelling"},"2014": {"requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"units": 12,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH3501","title": "Scientific and Industrial Modelling"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH3511","title": "Scientific Computing"}]]},{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "COMP1100","title": "Introduction to Programming and Algorithms"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "COMP1130","title": "Introduction to Advanced Computing I"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "COMP1730","title": "Programming for Scientists"}]]},{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "STAT1003","title": "Statistical Techniques"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "STAT1008","title": "Quantitative Research Methods"}]]},{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH2305","title": "Differential Equations and Applications"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH2405","title": "Maths Methods 1 Honours: Ordinary Differential Equations and Advanced Vector Calculus"}]]},{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH2306","title": "Partial Differential Equations and Applications"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH2406","title": "Maths Methods 2 Honours:  Partial Differential Equations,  Fourier Analysis and Complex Analysis"}]]},{"type": "maximum","units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH2307","title": "Bioinformatics and Biological Modelling"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH2320","title": "Analysis 1 Honours: Metric Spaces and Applications"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "COMP2130","title": "Software Analysis and Design"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "STAT2001","title": "Introductory Mathematical Statistics"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "STAT2008","title": "Regression Modelling"}]]},{"type": "minimum","units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH3029","title": "Probability Modelling with Applications"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH3062","title": "Fractal Geometry & Applications to Digital Imaging"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH3116","title": "Applied Analysis 1 Honours: Metric Spaces and Applications"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH3133","title": "Environmental Mathematics"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH3320","title": "Analysis 2 Honours: Topology, Lebesgue Integration and Hilbert Spaces"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH3512","title": "Matrix Computations"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "MATH3514","title": "Numerical Optimisation"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "COMP3320","title": "High Performance Scientific Computation"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "COMP3600","title": "Algorithms"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "STAT3008","title": "Applied Statistics"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "STAT3004","title": "Stochastic Modelling"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "STAT3015","title": "Generalised Linear Modelling"}]]}]},"learning_outcomes": "Students who complete the major in Mathematical Modelling will be able to: \n1.

MATH1013 or MATH1115; MATH1014 or MATH1116; COMP1100 or COMP1130 or COMP1730; and either STAT1003 or STAT1008 By its nature, mathematical modelling is a general topic. For the non-compulsory courses in the major, we recommend that students choose two courses that fit into one of the groups listed below. The three different groupings allow students to emphasis different aspects depending on their interests. Analytical Mathematical Modelling 11. MATH3116: Applied Analysis 1 Honours: Metric Spaces and Applications or MATH2320: Analysis 1 Honours: Metric Spaces and Applications, plus one of the following courses\n12. MATH3512: Matrix Computations or MATH3514: Numerical Optimisation\n13. MATH3320: Analysis 2 Honours: Topology, Lebesgue Integration and Hilbert Spaces\n Computational Mathematical Modelling 14. MATH3512: Matrix Computations or MATH3514: Numerical Optimisation , plus one of the following courses\n15. COMP3320: High Performance Scientific Computing.\n16. COMP2130: Software Analysis and Design.\n17. COMP3420: Advanced Databases and Data Mining.\n18.

STAT2001: Introductory Mathematical Statistics.\n29. STAT3004: Stochastic Modelling\n The courses in Analytical Mathematical Modelling focus more on the theoretical aspects of modelling. Students considering honours in mathematics with a major in Mathematical Modelling should take the courses in Analytical Mathematical Modelling, along with any other mathematics HPC courses of interest. Students interested in further research in a quantitative discipline may also benefit from the analytical skills developed in this major. The courses in Computational Mathematical Modelling focus more on scientific computing. They are intended for students with both a strong interest in mathematics and computing. Students interested in doing honours in Computational Science should take the courses in Computational Mathematical Modelling. Students interested in further research in a discipline with a strong computational component, such as astronomy, can benefit from the technical skills developed in this major. The courses in Applied Mathematical Modelling are aimed at students interested in developing their skills in building and interpreting models. This includes students whose primary interest is in an application area, such as physics or economics, but wants a better understanding of the models used in their discipline. It also includes students who have more of a professional or vocational focus. Students may be interested in taking this particular grouping of courses with more qualitative courses that better help them communicate their analysis to a wider audience. Students should be aware of the need to complete the pre-requisites for the level 2000 and 3000 courses. In particular, note that some of the courses are HPC courses. Also, to undertake later year computer science courses it is generally required to undertake 12 units of 2000-level COMP courses. Students should seek further course advice from the academic convener of this Mathematical Modelling major. Relevant Degrees 30.  Bachelor of Languages (BLANG) \n31.  Bachelor of Science (BSC) \n32.

The two later year compulsory courses provide a broad understanding of styles of music writing (such as music criticism), as well as key theoretical and methodological skills, including an introduction to the study of key types of research documents and culminates on the writing of a research project using resources in one of Canberra's cultural institutions. Thereafter, a wide range of academic music courses are available to students for them to complete the additional required 24 units of musicology to gain a robust preparation for Honours and postgraduate research in musicology.","title": "Musicology"}}}

It is a broad ranging discipline that spans topics including perceiving and thinking, the biological basis of behaviour, research methodology, child development, perception and cognition, social psychology and personality. Students taking the psychology major will gain an understanding of how to apply the scientific perspective to psychological phenomena in the laboratory and in the real world.Within the major there is flexibility to select courses to meet individual career objectives. The intention of the Psychology major is to ensure the acquisition of contemporary knowledge in psychological theory and evidence across core themes in psychological science.Learning Goals:Students who have completed the Psychology major will be able to: Explain major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology. Differentiate theoretical and empirical frameworks that have defined and shaped the field. Define key concepts that characterise psychology as a field of scientific inquiry as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines. Relate how social (eg environmental/cultural), and biological (genes, hormones) factors jointly shape human behavior. Apply basic research methods in psychology to investigate psychological questions and to research design, data analysis, and interpretation. Use critical inquiry, and, when possible, the scientific approach to solve problems related to behavior and mental processes. Identify relevant psychological mechanisms/issues and apply to real world or other contexts. Apply psychological principles to personal, social, and organisational issues. Critically analyse data and research, including methodology, results and conclusions. Articulate some of the central questions and issues in contemporary psychology. Critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in the popular media. Identify and critically evaluate appropriate disciplinary research sources Evaluate information from a statistical perspective drawing on basic statistical concepts. Develop competence in interpreting graphical data to understand what is being compared/manipulated (independent variables) and what is being measured (dependent variables).

The field of environment and sustainability provides multiple examples of complex, wicked problems important to humanity, including climate change, food and water security and ecological sustainability. Using quantitative modelling to help solve environmental problems requires an holistic understanding of environmental and Earth systems, supported by an appropriate level of mathematical training and skill. You will develop the necessary mathematical understanding for environmental quantification, including the knowledge of differential equations and vector calculus that are the foundation of most dynamical environmental modelling. The experience in spatial analysis and/or measurement of environmental data that is fundamental in environmental and Earth system science is also part of this major. Modelling applications are discussed in courses focused on the science of the environment (including weather, climate and climate change, surface hydrology and groundwater, biodiversity and landscape ecology, fire behaviour, and palaeo-environments).","title": "Quantitative Environmental Modelling"}}}

In addition to the six compulsory courses, the Science Communication major must include 12 units of additional courses, for which there are several options to choose from. Students are encouraged to investigate each additional option and to follow their professional and intellectual interests when making a decision. Students who are considering a future as a professional science communicator or science communication researcher are encouraged to choose SCOM3003 Special Topics in Science Communication to make up 6 or 12 additional units. This course allows students to devise their own project topic, which can have a focus on research, theory or practice. The flexibility of this course allows the greatest scope for extending your science communication expertise. Students who prefer the more rigid structure of coursework are encouraged to choose one of the discipline specific additional courses (BIOL3191, ENVS3007, ENVS3028, or SCNC3200) or to consider a Masters level SCOM course. Students who are undertaking another 3000 level science course that they believe comprises aspects that are relevant to science communication are invited to discuss their situation with the Undergraduate Convener. It is possible for the Convener to approve the inclusion of such a course within a student's Science Communication major sequence. Other course options may be considered with permission of the major convener. Students should seek further course advice from the academic convener of this Science Communication major.

Completion of a sociology major will enable students to:Understand key dimensions of social experience (such as ethnicity, class, race, gender, age, sexual preference, disability, religion, and nationality).Use sociological theories and methods to analyse social issues.Assess the merits of competing theoretical approaches to sociology.Communicate sociological knowledge to specialist and non-specialist audiences.","title": "Sociology"},"2017": {"requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY3124","title": "Transforming Society: Towards a Public Sociology"}]]},{"type": "minimum","units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY1002","title": "Self and Society"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY1004","title": "Analysing the Social World: An Introduction to Social Psychology"}]]},{"type": "minimum","units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2038","title": "Introduction to Quantitative Research Methods"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2043","title": "Introduction to Qualitative Research Methods"}]]},{"type": "minimum","units": 6,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2040","title": "Classical Social Theory"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2161","title": "Contemporary Social Theory"}]]},{"type": "maximum","units": 24,"courses": [[{"units": 6,"code": "ANTH2136","title": "Piracy: Property Wars from the High Seas to Anonymous"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "CRIM2002","title": "Organised Crime: Understanding the Underworld"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "CRIM2003","title": "Controversies in Crime Control"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "CRIM2004","title": "Dimensions of Crime: Identifying and Controlling Offenders"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "CRIM2005","title": "Alcohol, Drugs and Crime: Promoting Health and Preventing Consequences"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "CRIM2006","title": "Young People and Crime: Developmental Criminology and its Discontents"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "CRIM2008","title": "Comparative Criminology: Punishment in Australia and Across the Globe"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "CRIM2009","title": "Corruption in our world"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "CRIM3002","title": "Corruption in Sport"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "DEMO2001","title": "Population Studies"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "DEMO2002","title": "Population Analysis"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "GEND2023","title": "Gender, Sex and Sexuality: An Introduction to Feminist Theory"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "GEND3001","title": "Posthuman Bodies"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "POLS2096","title": "Genocide Studies"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "POLS2100","title": "Genocide - Post 1945"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2008","title": "Risk in Everyday Life"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2021","title": "Education and Society"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2022","title": "Environmental Sociology"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2026","title": "Excessive Appetites: Sociocultural Perspectives on Addiction, Drug Use and Gender"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2030","title": "Sociology of Third World Development"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2053","title": "Imagining the Future: A Sociology of Utopias"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2055","title": "Social Inequality in Comparative Perspective"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2057","title": "Relationships, Marriage and Family"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2059","title": "Sociology of Resistance"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2060","title": "Mobile Societies"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2101","title": "Social Policy: Principles and Practice"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2157","title": "Surveillance and Society"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2162","title": "Sociology of Health and Illness"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2163","title": "Identity, Difference and Racism"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2164","title": "Research for Public Policy"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2165","title": "Public Sphere & Media"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2166","title": "Social Science of the Internet"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2167","title": "Populism"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY2168","title": "Special Topics in Sociology"}],[{"units": 6,"code": "SOCY3001","title": "Research Internship"}]]}],"x_from_category": [{"type": "minimum","level": [3000],"units": 6}],"max_by_level": [{"type": "maximum","level": [1000],"units": 12}]},"learning_outcomes": "Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: \n1.

It explores how identities and societies are formed by virtue of activity occurring in different social contexts. Sociologists examine a wide spectrum of behaviours and they evaluate how and why different social problems and inequalities emerge, how they are experienced, and how they are responded to. The discipline draws on a diverse range of theoretical perspectives and methodological techniques to study the social underpinnings of key concerns, including climate change, surveillance, local and global conflicts, and health and education inequalities.Students develop a 'sociological imagination', a way of thinking that enables them to (a) problematise taken-for-granted assumptions; (b) ask critically informed questions; (c) engage in systematic research; and (d) formulate in-depth analytical understandings of social behaviour and relations. A sociology degree provides students with a cognitive and transferable skill set and it empowers them to participate in wider intellectual and policy debates about key social issues. It is therefore a recognised and valued qualification in a range of careers.","title": "Sociology"}}}

This major gives students the tools to understand and analyse the social and cultural drivers and impacts of technological change. It also enables students to develop skills in cutting-edge digital methods and to use these to conduct online social research, including research that addresses audiences beyond the university.Technology, Networks and Society adopts a primarily sociological perspective to analyse the social impact of technological change. It explores central sociological concerns such as social inequalities and stratification, identity and embodiment, social movements, social change, production and consumption and the nature of power, all in the context of technological transformation. However, it is an interdisciplinary major, drawing on insights from communication and media studies, cultural studies, science and technology studies, economics, geography and political science.","title": "Technology, Networks and Society"}}}

Effective use and management of water resources will continue to be one of the highest priorities for local, regional and federal authorities due to increased pressure from population growth, agricultural, commercial and industrial growth, and environmental and climate change.The major in Water Science provides students with the opportunity to develop their understanding of water resources, including surface water and groundwater in terrestrial and coastal environments. This is important in understanding interactions between, and impacts on, the hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere and lithosphere, all part of Earth Systems. Students completing this major will have the expertise to interpret quantitatively surface and groundwater flow and water quality data, design monitoring programs for water resources and provide the technical results to underpin effective management strategies and policies for the use of water resources.There are many career opportunities for students that complete this major.
