This specialisation explores the major classes of microorganisms and the mammalian and other immune systems, which have evolved to combat pathogenic microorganisms.

Distinguish and classify a range of microorganisms, with specific emphasis on bacteria, viruses and parasites and describe the life cycles, metabolism, and genetics of classes of microorganisms.2.

Master advanced skills and concepts in Physics.. 2. Systematically evaluate relevant theory and concepts, relate these to appropriate methodologies and evidence, and draw appropriate conclusions. 3. Make a systematic and critical review of appropriate and relevant information sources. 4. Develop the ability to apply experimental techniques and methods to collect original research data in the field of study. In the case of theoretical research, learn the application of relevant advanced mathematical concepts and techniques. 5. Analyse and interpret original science research data with statistical or other evaluative processes where appropriate 6. Plan, consult and engage in an independent and sustained critical investigation of a chosen research topic to generate new knowledge in the chosen area of physics. 7. Effectively and compellingly communicate scientific material to a variety of audiences. Additional InformationThe assessment aligns with the learning outcomes and includes 24 units of honours level coursework (4 x 6 units, 50%, LO 1,2,3,7) 24 units research project assessed by thesis (93%) and oral (7%) presentation (LO 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) For more information on the Honours year in Science, please visit:http://science.anu.edu.au/study/bachelor-degrees/honours-yearFor more information on how to apply for Honours in Science include deadlines, please visit:http://science.anu.edu.au/study/how-apply/honours-year-application Relevant Degrees \n1.

Students examine how actors both within and outside government seek to communicate, advocate and participate in the policy process. Particular emphasis is given to the form and nature of policy communication, persuasion, public engagement, and public talk. Students study the principles of effective policy communication, persuasion and participatory policy making including policy argumentation, rhetoric, inclusion, participation, representation and legitimacy. Through applied examples and cases students consider the practicalities, challenges and politics involved in realising these ideals in contemporary governance.
