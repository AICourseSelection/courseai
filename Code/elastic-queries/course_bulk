Drawing upon engineering history and human-machine relationships, but considering these via social geography and anthropology, this course will discuss how aviation developed in relation to other forms of transportation and surveillance, as well as how âhuman factorsâ discourses are used to assess aviation disasters. Next, it will examine aviation labor, taking on board theory and approaches from gender studies: from the highly sexualised, sometimes Orientalised icon of the flight attendant. Who is Singapore Girl? What does she represent? How do Thai Airways flight attendants use Buddhist philosophy to cope with the stresses of their job? Finally, the consumers of aviation: passengers and cargo. How has the container revolution changed our tastes in foods? How have the demographics of the flying public changed? How have marketing strategies and loyalty programs sought to segment elites?

The course begins with an examination of key institutions in India: its social system and cultural practices. It draws on the history and ethnography of South Asia, and the major concepts that framed the discipline of anthropology, as inseparable from the colonialism in Asia. The first part of the course will Â primarily focus on the foundations of Indian society, its social, cultural and political make up, before moving to main part of the course which focuses on technology.The second part of the course investigates the multiple effects of technological schemes and innovation in India and their implications for social life. What do we mean by technology? What is the relationship between technology and social order and cultural values? How has technology, as part of India's embrace of economic reforms, reshaped society and the politics of identity? What is the role of the state and private enterprise in promoting technological innovations? These are some of the question we will cover.The final part of the course will focus on the effects of neoliberalism on both private and public spheres, in promoting policies and ideologies that continue to be key drivers in shaping ideologies and everyday practices in India and its vast diaspora.

For Buddhists, enlightenment is attained by gaining insight into the nature of reality (metaphysics), knowledge (epistemology), language (philosophy of language) and our ways of living (ethics). These insights are acquired, in large part, by subjecting our beliefs to rational scrutiny. In this course, we critically examine some of the core issues in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of language and ethics that are elaborated by Buddhist philosophers. The course proceeds by analyzing some core texts of Buddhist philosophy (in English translation) together with some secondary literature. We study Buddhist philosophy not as an item of historical and cultural interest but as an attempt to ascertain how much truth lies in this system of thought. Once we gain an understanding of the views expounded by Buddhist philosophers, we will subject their doctrines to rational scrutiny in the hope of attaining some enlightenment for ourselves.", "outcome": "Demonstrate a general knowledge of some major schools, figures and issues in the Buddhist tradition of PhilosophyExpress and expound views and pre-suppositions of Buddhist philosophers clearly and lucidly;Understand and critically evaluate theories, arguments and presuppositions of Buddhist philosophers" }

Â What were the origins of this attempt? Â How did it affect people's behaviour? How did it affect Chinese culture? Â And how successful was it in changing people's ideas and values? Â In the second part of the course it will explore the enormous changes that have occurred since the beginning of the Reform Era in 1978. Â Why did Deng and his successors relax controls over language and discourse? Â What social and economic changes have encouraged the emergence of new discourses and cultural forms? Â What opportunities have been created by the explosive growth of the internet? Â How does the government continue to regulate the media and manipulate public debate? Â How have people sought to get around the restrictions? Â What critical discourses still manage to flourish?

{ "code":"ASIA2073", "title":"Continuing Portuguese II", "description": "Â âHad I been born Chinese, I would have been a calligrapher, not a painter.â said Pablo Picasso. Why was calligraphy so attractive to him? Why has the art of writing lines become so appealing? Chinese calligraphy certainly is a âsecond to noneâ art form, and is without doubt the most important form of art in Chinese history. In daily and academic lives, Chinese words/characters are not only for embodying meaning, but also for various purposes of cultural expression, such as writing, artistic performing, religion, aesthetics and philosophy, social life and âtempering personalityâ. In fact, it is rare to find any Chinese literati without the ability to function in this art in earlier historical periods. Therefore, it can be said that Chinese culture truly is a filled âculture of words.âAdditionally, Chinese history is closely reflected in the long development of Chinese characters, which has evolved into different styles. It creates a set of delicate and profound Chinese aesthetic theory, which echoes Chinese art theory and philosophy, such as âthe vacuity vs. substanceâ (or âthe empty/illusionaryâ vs. âthe real/full/solid/the substanceâ), and loose vs. density, or the dialectical relationship betweenâblackness vs. whitenessâ (or the black line vs. the white space). Chinese calligraphy can also be said to be a unique abstract art through linear expression. In Taiwan, Mainland China, Korea and Japan, postgraduate degrees in calligraphy are offered in Chinese or art departments. Learning and knowing Chinese calligraphy as such is necessary for all Chinese studies, especially those wanting an advanced understanding about Chinese history and culture.This course provides students with a general, yet profound, introduction to Chinese calligraphy. Through practice and knowledge acquirement, such as holding a brush, writing and knowing the knowledge of the four treasuresâ, students can experience this ancient Chinese art and cultivate an interest for Chinese culture. As simplified Chinese has gradually become a dominant trend nowadays, traditional Chinese nevertheless is still a genuine access point to Chinese culture and Sinology in terms of its history, aesthetics and philosophy and literati circles. Simplified vs. traditional characters also reflects in different Chinese societies, namely Mainland China and Taiwan. Students will learn how to write and appreciate this âart of lines,â accompanied by the knowledge of its history and theory.", "outcome": "nan" }

Even after the collapse of the major historic imperial powers during the second half of the twentieth century, the legacies of those empires continue to shape contemporary life. And historians and political analysts still talk in terms of - and seek to redefine - imperialism in reference to present polities.Â Â China is central to such discourses on imperial power: it offers a particularly rich body of historical evidence for the practice of empire. This introductory course will therefore assess that evidence and survey the great drama of Chinese attempts to bring under single control and preserve the unity of its vast territories, so varied ethnically, culturally, and geographically. It will take in the full sweep of China's imperial past: it will start in the third century BC, when the foundations of the imperial system were consolidated; it will reach into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when encounters with Western powers forced a radical reappraisal of the Chinese imperial system. Dividing this broad chronological scope into three periods - early China, medieval China, and late imperial China - it will offer a sense of larger changes and continuities over time. Within each period, it will bring into sharp focus the social, cultural, and political arenas in which Chinese empire was developed and maintained.", "outcome": "nan" }

In asking this question Contemporary Social Theory puts forward a case for the practical value of theory. It is not simply that empirical problems exist 'out there' in the world awaiting analysis, but the way that we figure and think through a problem is a good part of its solution. Most importantly, then, the course aims to develop skills and give you confidence in your capacity to think, so that you can engage with issues and empirical problems in an original way.Â While Contemporary Social Theory covers some of the important thinkers of the post- war period, its aim is not to provide a comprehensive survey of the vast array of social theorists that you might find in a text on social or sociological theory. The idea is to expose you to some of the key problems that have animated sociology and cognate disciplines in recent years, with the hope that you might have a window into these and similar theoretical and practical problems. On the way through the course, we will pay attention to the question of what it means for thinking to be 'contemporary'. The issue of how we grasp what 'our present' is raises important questions about who the 'we' is here, as well as the relationship between thinking and time. In exploring these and other theoretical questions, the course will relate key theoretical problems to diverse empirical examples - from consumerism and globalisation to terrorism, the information and genetic revolutions and the role of science - with the hope that it will bring the theories alive for you.Â ", "outcome": "nan" }

To what degree is public understanding of crime culturally mediated and influenced by specific rhetorics?  Which groups and interests effectively dictate crime control policies and criminal justice system agendas?

Examples of thinking skills are interpreting, analysing, evaluating, explaining, sequencing, reasoning, comparing, questioning, inferring,hypothesising, appraising, testing and generalising. Creative thinking involves students in learning to generate and apply new ideas in specific contexts, seeing existing situations in a new way, identifying alternative explanations, and seeing or making new links that generate a positive outcome. This includes combining parts to form something original, sifting and refining ideas to discover possibilities, constructing theories and objects, and acting on intuition.

Course topics include: population size and structure in the past and present; the biology of natural fertility; social factors controlling fertility; mortality and the impact of varying life expectancies; population pressure on resources and consequences for migration; marital mobility, marriage practices, kinship systems and sex ratios; the demography of small-scale societies; health, nutrition and the demographic effect of epidemics; demographic implications of warfare; change, development and demographic transitions. Quantitative demographic techniques are introduced but not pursued in depth. Examples are drawn from around the world, including the Australasian region. The course is designed on the premise that what is distinctive about the anthropological (in the broad sense) approach to population is its concern with the processes that lie behind population numbers more than the numbers themselves, and its comparative perspective across cultures and from the distant past to the present.", "outcome": "Master the essentials of the factual groundwork and demonstrate awareness of key facts and the contributions of pivotal authors in the literature which examines human population dynamics cross-culturally and (in the broad sense) anthropologicallyDemonstrate a secure grasp of fundamental concepts in anthropological demography and demographic anthropologyMaster basic demographic methods and measures sufficiently to be able to calculate simpler measures and draw correct inferences from quantitative results on fertility, mortality, migration and other demographic topics (but note that more advanced technical demography is covered in other courses)Use a selective case study approach to explain a topic or argument in the field orally to your peers, in a clear, concise, analytical and evidence-based manner, couched so as to elicit discussion; and respond thoughtfully to the substance of peersÃ¢ÂÂ similar contributionsDraw together material from a range of scholarly sources relevant to a topic or proposition in the field, to form a unified text which sets out your own independent, where appropriate critical, assessment of that material, balancing general argument and supporting evidence" }

It explores how health is at once a biological, social, and historical fact. Anthropology assumes a 'body' that is both biologically given as well as culturally invented and historically situated so that we can even speak of 'local biologies'. This course introduces methods of studying and understanding how the body, health, and healing are shaped by historical processes, political struggles and cultural meanings as well as the knowledge and power of expanding global biomedicine and biotechnologies. In offering a comparative perspective on human afflictions, suffering and healing in societies, we will explore the cultural and historical specificity of what appear to be biological givens, and do so by drawing from a variety of anthropological questions, theoretical approaches, and research methods. The course introduces both the specificity of local medical cultures and the global processes that increasingly link these systems of knowledge and practice. In examining the social and political economic shaping of illness and suffering we will identify how medical and healing systems - including biomedicine - as social institutions are also sources of epistemological authority. In the process, we will critically examine old and emergent biotechnologies and the way biomedical knowledge is produced, learned, and maintains authority over expanding areas of human life.Â ", "outcome": "Effectively apply an anthropological perspective to the study of the body, illness, disease, and healing, and in the analyses of contemporary local, national, and global health inequalities.Examine and place the development of select biotechnologies in their historical, sociocultural, and political contexts.

Why are some organisms found here, and not there? Why do plants and animals look and work like they do? What makes their populations large or small, or change in size? Why do some organisms co-exist together, and others not? Why is there so much diversity? In understanding these questions, we gain critical insight into how populations and communities have evolved, how energy and biomass flow through ecosystems, and how populations and communities respond to changes in their environment.

{ "code":"BIOL3131", "title":"Graduate Reading Course B", "description": "The aim of evolutionary and behavioural ecology is to understand how an animal is adapted to its environment, such as how an animal's behaviour contributes to its survival or reproduction. In this course we consider the outcomes of natural selection on animal behaviour and function, and discuss how we test adaptive hypotheses. We will do this by focussing on key issues in behavioural ecology. Our lectures are organised into four modules: trade-offs between costs and benefits for survival and reproduction, the principles of animal communication, the evolution of cooperation, and the biology of sex. We consider such questions as: How do individuals balance the need to get food yet avoid predators? How are communication signals designed and what do they mean? What stops animals lying? Why is cooperation potentially beneficial yet its evolution is difficult to understand? When is it advantageous to produce sons versus daughters? Why are individuals choosy when selecting a mate? Why do males care for young in some species but not others?Â  These areas cover research topics of interest to the strong behavioural ecology group at ANU, and we will include our current research as well as that carried out worldwide. The overall aim of the course is to develop a logical approach that can be applied to understanding and testing any question in evolutionary biology.", "outcome": "recognise when behaviour poses difficulties for accepted wisdom and theorythink strategically on how to formulate and test adaptive hypothesescommunicate problems and their solutions to both an intelligent public and a community of informed scientistsread the literature critically to assimilate views on new findings and present these views in writing." }

Transgressions of familiar gender roles through practices such as cross-dressing can reflect a culture's fascination with, but also concern about, larger processes of political or social change. This course examines texts from three key moments in modern German history, reflecting on how ideas of gender have changed or stayed the same over time. We will investigate gender representations in Weimar Classicism around 1800, examining excerpts from canonical authors such as Lessing and Goethe, before moving on to media and literary representations from Germany's Weimar Republic (1918-1933), a period often described in terms of crisis and decadence. Finally, we will examine gender in the German present, using film as a platform for thinking about how representations of gender transgression continue to shape popular culture and ideas about identity in significant ways. Students who have completed this course will demonstrate advanced levels of spoken and written expression that accord to the conventions of academic German, in addition to substantial discipline-based research skills.Â ", "outcome": "Analyse, critique, and undertake research on literary representations in German from the 19th, 20th and 21st centuriesAnalyse, critique, and undertake research on visual representations of gender from the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuriesDemonstrate advanced reading comprehension skills in German through engagement with a wide range of literary, visual, scholarly, and popular culture materialsDemonstrate an advanced level of spoken German, including skills in formal class presentations Demonstrate an advanced level of written German, including in German academic writing and analysis" }

From the 1960s so-called 'new social movements', including women's, lesbian and gay and environmental movements, transformed the social and political landscape of western societies. These movements promoted new forms of organisation, tactics and ideas such as the politics of oppression, identity and culture, empowerment and post-materialism. More recently, an increasingly global civil society has emerged with a variety of indigenous, third-world, anti-corporate globalisation, international trade union and social justice movements.

{ "code":"ANTH3017", "title":"Logic", "description": "Over the last forty years, a global discourse of indigeneity and indigenous peoples has emerged, originating and diffusing in the 1980s and onwards from particular nation-states. This internationalist concept of indigeneity had been centered in the United Nations, and enshrined in documents of other multilateral organisations (the World Bank, International Labor Organisation). Peoples now often regarded as `indigenous' have long existed - but this category is relatively recent, as are many developments associated with it.Like other such global discourses (e.g. `nationalism'), how indigeneity is understood varies across particular contexts. Its global dissemination makes such variability inevitable, and the question of how it intersects with particular socio-economic-political conjunctures, essential. Generally speaking, indigenous-settler dynamics (such as are found in Australia, North America, New Zealand, and parts of Latin America) have been, in some respects, most receptive of the collective, internationally-authored, `indigenous' socio-political identity. For example, Australia as a state accepts the notion that it is home to `indigenous' people. The recent concept of indigeneity has been seen as more ambiguous, unsettling, or downright threatening, hence less acceptable, in many Asian, East and South Asian, as well as African countries. This course will examine the intersections of international concept and national circumstances, both conceptually and by case studies.This course will look at questions of the emergence of an internationalist global category from two principal directions underpinned by readings from anthropological theorists on: the reification of cultural constructs, capitalist constructions of meaning, and the exercise of powers of recognition and legitimation, the changing role of nation-states globally (Bourdieu, Foucault, Wolf); and more political-economically situated ideas concerning the current global conjuncture, how and why this particular kind of internationalist category has emerged and its intersection with what Kalb (2009) calls `âcritical junctionsâ that link global process via particular national arenas and local histories, often hidden, to emergent and situated events and narrativesâ¦'Students will work through a number of case studies of indigenous peoples and settings; and discuss what has happened in various cases, the extent to which the category `indigenous' has been mobilized concerning and by particular groups, and consider what the future of this category of `indigeneity' may be.Â ", "outcome": "Discuss the history of events and factors in the emergence of examples of international and national indigenous movements and activisms.Understand the relation of this emergence to theory and practice both in development and anthropology.Draw upon major theoretical debates in anthropology in terms of which this emergence has been understood, and to interpret and evaluate these theoretical approaches.

But both its foreign policy and its regional and international security policy have often been criticised as insufficient to achieve this goal. What, then, have been the hurdles to Indonesia's development into a key diplomatic and security actor? What have successive Indonesian presidents done to overcome these obstacles and increase Indonesia's international weight? How do Indonesia's neighbors, including Australia, view Indonesia's foreign and security potential, and its limitations? What is the most likely trajectory of Indonesia's foreign and security role in the decades ahead?In this course, we will investigate the questions outlined above, and evaluate Indonesia's status in the web of regional powers in the Asia-Pacific region. In doing so, we will also reflect on key theoretical and conceptual questions in regards to the sources of a country's diplomatic and strategic power.

Yet the Cold War never really ended in the Asia-Pacific. Its legacy is still very much apparent in the form of the America-led bilateral network of security alliances and with the persistence of dangerous flashpoints on the Korean Peninsula and across the Taiwan Strait. Longstanding historical tensions persist between Japan and Korea, China and Japan and India and Pakistan, to name just a few. In the interim, new powers such as China and India have risen at impressive rates, spending some of their newfound wealth on increasingly sophisticated weaponry. All of this, in turn, has created new interstate security dilemmas in the Asia-Pacific region and has generated speculation that a new 'arms race' is emerging as more established players respond in kind to these acquisitions.

In particular, we will investigate how the locally embodied cultural practices meshed with the fast changing socioeconomic and cultural circumstances in Korea as well as the unprecedented pace of globalization in order to understand Korea within the broader regional and global context.The course places special focus on the films of five prominent South Korean directors. Each director is known for his or her unique style and mode of representation of a particular theme. Throughout the semester, we will touch onÂ a variety ofÂ topics, including traditional aesthetics, the division of the Korean nation, the turbulent contemporary political environment,Â the rise ofÂ consumerism, violence, and the reinvention of Korean tradition and national identity in a rapidly globalizing world.Â We will also give special attention to the films' treatment of characters on the margins of society.

It addresses the central question of who has the ability or the authority to make choices where language and its use is concerned, and whose will and whose choices will ultimately prevail. In a world where multilingualism and variation in language is the norm and monolingualism the exception, migration and technological advances have generated new challenges for language policy makers, causing new issues of language choice to emerge.The core issues to be addressed in this course are: How and why national and official languages are chosen and what this means politically in a society; How language education policy can affect members of a society; How the spread of English as a world language has affected the linguistic ecology of societies around the globe, and how its spread is related to the proliferation of World Englishes; How societies treat indigenous languages; How minority language rights pose challenges for policy makers at the national and supranational level.

Examining actual legal cases gives students experience in relating abstract economic models to practical problems and demonstrates their direct relevance.Although economics can help explain law, the influence of the law on the economy is far more important. Legal and political foundations underlie economic performance. The law is an important social institution and incentive structure that provides a foundation for the economic order and plays a central role in determining social outcomes, yet economists often take it for granted.Understanding law helps us better understand the workings of the economic system. Economic analysis rests on a bedrock of legal relations that law and economics explicitly analyses. Free markets do not exist within a vacuum, but need a legal framework that protects property, enforces contracts and allows free exchange to flourish. Law provides the framework in which firms and individuals decide on their actions in the economic sphere.Â For law students, Judge Richard Posner (one of the founders of law and economics) explains the benefits of law and economics well: âThe law is divided into numerous fields, each of which has a complex structure of rules. The fields are traditionally studied in isolation from one another, and within each field the rules tend also to be studied as a separate, often self-enclosed bodies of thought. Yet it turns out that a relative handful of economic doctrines - such as decision under uncertainty, transactions costs, cost benefit analysis, risk aversion, and positive and negative externalities - can, by repeated application across fields of law and legal rules, describe a great deal of the legal system and enable the student to develop a more coherent sense of the system - to grasp the relation of its parts and understand its essential unity.âThe 'economic approach' to law provides a unified vision of the law, tying together diverse areas of law into a common theoretical structure. The logic of the problems the law exists to solve is the same across all the standard fields, making it possible to understand a wide variety of legal issues in terms of one central set of interrelated concepts. Understanding the economics of property helps you understand torts and contracts, rather than treating them as isolated fields.The important interdependencies between law and economics mean understanding law improves economic analysis and economic analysis is a useful tool for understanding law and for devising laws that improve society and economic performance.TextbookA.

However, in this elective course, we are interested in a different kind of foundation. We will interrogate not the foundations of any particular legal system, but the foundations of law itself. Whereas the 'Foundations of Australian Law' equips students with the foundational skills of legal reasoning, this elective course invites students to take a step back to consider and interrogate the foundational mythologies of law. We will explore the 'Foundations of Law' through the humanistic disciplines of classics, literature, philosophy and theology: we will read classical plays (e.g. Antigone), contemporary novels (e.g. Lord of the Flies), philosophical works (e.g. Genealogy of Morals), and theological writings (e.g. Genesis and Exodus).

{ "code":"CHIN2019", "title":"Project Monitoring and Control", "description": "Literary Chinese is a written language that matured long before the Qin dynasty (221-206 B.C.), when China first became an empire. It continued to be used by China's governing and elite cultures for nearly three millennia. A command of Literary Chinese is therefore indispensable for the study of any aspect of Chinese literature, thought, history, politics, or society before the twentieth century.The idioms, syntax, style, and allusions of Literary Chinese continue to pervade the modern language. Its enduring influence results from the fact that the great legacies of Chinese culture, right down to the present day, have been largely preserved in this medium. Contemporary Chinese political and social discourse, and education, places increasing emphasis on knowledge of pre-modern Chinese culture and on familiarity with texts written in Literary Chinese. So without a grounding in Literary Chinese, it is impossible to gain a full understanding of the language or content of newspaper articles, literary works, and scholarly prose written in contemporary Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the People's Republic of China. It has also shaped the linguistic and cultural traditions of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.This course focuses on the analysis and translation of a selection of texts for beginners from the pre-Qin (before 221 BC) and Han (206 BC to 220 AD) periods. Students develop an understanding of the main grammatical forms, function words, and sentence patterns of this formative period of Literary Chinese. Students will also study techniques of translation, as well as the cultural backgrounds essential to understanding the texts at hand.", "outcome": "nan" }

{ "code":"ASIA2093", "title":"Seminar in Advanced Historiography", "description": "Violent conflicts over natural resources are an enduring feature of social and political life at different scales and levels of organisation. The inter-state and geopolitical dimensions of conflicts over resources such as oil and water loom large in the popular imaginary. However, resource conflicts in the global South are predominantly fought internally, within the boundaries of the nation-state. Indeed, according to the United Nations, at least 40 percent of internal conflicts globally are related to natural resources. It is these sorts of conflicts that are the focus of this course.A striking conundrum lies at the heart of the inquiry: rather thanÂ  contributing to peace and prosperity, empirical research demonstrates that natural resource wealth increases the likelihood that a country will experience internal armed conflict. How and why is this the case? What about the role of resource scarcity as driver of violent conflict in developing-country contexts? What sort of policy responses and interventions are available? How might natural resource wealth contribute to peace rather than to conflict? What is the role of political and economic contestation in these struggles over land and natural resources?The course will be structured around a series of case studies drawn from Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. A political ecology framework will be applied to the analysis of how land and different types of resource complexesÂ  - including mining, oil and gas, forestry, and oil palm - can be implicated in violent conflict. Alongside these case studies, students will undertake their own analysis of a natural resource conflict in which they will be attentive to the role of different actors - especially the state, communities and corporations - and to questions of scale, power and identity.The course will have a very strong research-led approach to teaching and learning.

In this course we introduce the participants to the exciting potential of reconstructing past environments and how this might inform future challenges.Existing lines of evidence for past environmental change in Australia come from a range of palaeoecological and archaeological sources and point to significant changes in climate, biodiversity, vegetation cover and fire frequency since the arrival of people sometime between 50,000 - 40,000 years ago. The degree to which humans overrode otherwise natural processes of environmental change and the extent of this modification however, is a global issue.Â Through this course students will gain the temporal perspective necessary for understanding many contemporary environmental issues such as climate change, biological responses to environmental change and land degradation. Students will be introduced to the methods and techniques used to reconstruct past environments primarily through the field collection and laboratory analysis of a range of palaeoenvironmental indicators such as lake sediment, pollen, charcoal, seeds, biogenic silica and stable isotopes. Â Common statistical and computing approaches for the acquisition, interpretation and modelling of proxy environmental data are also explored. The course is designed to provide students with an understanding as well as the practical skills to engage in palaeoecology, palaeoclimatology, archaeological science and natural resource management research.Â Additional readings of greater conceptual difficulty requiring an advanced scientific understanding will be made available for students enrolled at the graduate level.", "outcome": "Describe the natural and anthropogenic drivers of past environmental change at a global as well as regional level.Describe and explain the techniques that are used to reconstruct past environmental conditions in Australia and abroad.Analyse and reconstruct past environmental conditions using appropriate field and laboratory techniques.Interpret palaeo-environmental data from a range of sedimentary contexts.Reflect on the natural and human influences that explain past environmental conditions and be able to communicate these in ways appropriate to a range of audiences." }

Turning to major debates in the field, it explores the question of whether it is ever 'just' to use violence for political ends; the concept of 'non-violence' in theory and practice; and debates over external intervention (including the R2P debate, various 'soft' and 'hard' power approaches and the role and efficacy of the UN). We then investigate key approaches in the field - such as conflict prevention, conflict management, conflict resolution and conflict transformation (and the relationship between these approaches). The role that human security, human rights and international law plays in such processes is also examined. The course then turns to the relationship that conflict resolution has to peacekeeping, peace-enforcing and post-conflict situations.

There is much controversy in the field regarding causes of dieback; however, various factors are implicated including carbon starvation, hydraulic failure, vulnerability to biotic stress and phenology and how these drivers interact with elevated atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide. You will investigate the causes of dieback through four modules driven by key researchers and through exposure to disciplinary controversies around the significance, role, and interplay of these factors on plant health, adaptation and survival. The course has a weekend field trip to Kioloa to identify and classify plants based on systematics and to consider evidence of vegetation changes arising from climate change and environmental stressors. There are several pre-field trip practical which will include living and herbarium specimens for first-hand examples of the plant groups and their characteristics.

A requirement of Engineers Australia, as part of the degree accreditation, is that ALL students MUST complete the equivalent of 12 weeks of full-time work experience outside the University during their studies. This is implemented in the BE degree at the ANU as the ENGN3100 course. Besides accreditation, the work experience has the following two purposes:   to expose the student to the workplace and workplace issues (such as human and industrial relations, job organisation, maintenance, safety and environmental issues).   to provide direct insight into professional engineering practice.It is the student's responsibility to obtain the employment. The School of Engineering provides several resources to help students find work experience, including an annual seminar held in second semester, an ENGN 3100 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document and a list of past employers (updated at the end of each semester).As a general rule, the ideal would be 12 weeks (420 hours) in an engineering environment where the student is working with or supervised by engineers. Also acceptable is 8 weeks in an engineering environment and remaining 4 weeks in any sort of employment. A variation of this scheme that may be acceptable in a handful of special cases is 4 weeks in any sort of employment, 4 weeks in employment in a technical industry of some kind and 4 weeks of work with engineers in an engineering environment. All work experience claimed must have been completed since the commencement of the degree.Students are required to submit a 10-15 page report upon completion of their work experience.

By examining threats to nonhuman primates we will also be looking at threats to these ecosystems in general and investigating options for long term conservation and viability. Some of the threats to be considered are habitat loss (both natural and anthropogenic), hunting of species for human consumption or medicinal use, the pet trade, and disease risk to humans and non-human primates that may result from such practices. We will investigate issues of primate conservation by first understanding how primate biology and how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence their vulnerability to threats. We will then look at how they interact with their natural environment and how we can determine population viability using population demographics, life history data and genetic variation. We will then discuss the primary causes of declines in primate populations, including analyses of major threats.", "outcome": "Integrate information learned about primate species biology and ecology with information regarding tropical forest dynamics to think about population viability and conservation in the long term;Identify key threats to primate species and the ecosystems they inhabit;Select and combine information from a variety of academic resources to identify the pros and cons of commonly used conservation tactics and to critically evaluate the role of conservation agencies in past and current conservation projects;Use a case study of the use of local traditions in grassroots conservation initiatives to understand how different cultures view primates and the importance of conserving them and their habitat; andUse historical examples to predict how biodiversity regions may be expected to respond to current habitat changes, both due to natural and anthropogenic phenomenon and to determine which species are more or less vulnerable to these new threats." }

Â Students also gain exposure to structural induction and proof, introduction to asymptotic analysis of basic data structures, abstract data types, modules, laziness, and streams. The functional paradigm demonstrates elegant solutions to many programming problems.The course also introduces imperative programming as an alternative paradigm to functional programming, highlighting similarities and contrasting differences. Students learn the basic ingredients of imperative programs: mutable variables, sequencing, conditionals, iteration, functions, eager evaluation, and side effects.The course also introduces students to standard productivity tools for software development that will be used throughout the course and remainder of the computer science degree. These include distributed software revision control systems.The Advanced version of this course covers these topics in more depth, allowing students to deepen their understanding and experience.", "outcome": "Apply fundamental programming concepts, using a functional programming language, to solve simple problems.Understand basic types and the benefits of static typing.Distinguish language definition from implementation, syntax and parsing from semantics and evaluation.

PHYS2013Â  introduces the basic theoretical concepts and formalism, including the wave mechanics developed by Schroedinger and others and some aspects of the matrix formalism first developed by Heisenberg. The course starts with an overview of the historical evidence that led to the development of a quantum theory of matter and light.Â  This is followed by an introduction to the key elements of quantum mechanics, including the statistical interpretation of wave functions, the role of operators and their connection with observables, and uncertainty.Â  These concepts are initially introduced and reinforced through relatively simple problems with analytic solutions, but computational solutions are also examined where appropriate. PHYS2013Â  provides the foundations for further studies of, for example, atomic and nuclear spectroscopy, elementary particle physics and solid state physics as well as more advanced quantum mechanics. It is thus a core course in that it provides the background needed for several courses offered at third year. There is a small laboratory component (shared with PHYS2020).Honours Pathway OptionThis course is offered as an advanced option.", "outcome": "nan" }

{ "code":"ENGL3034", "title":"Thesis", "description": "The reign of Elizabeth I fostered a new social technology - the public theatre - and with it an explosion of playwriting that has influenced how we think about power and public identity to this day. But how did having a woman in charge influence this evolving artform? The Queen staged her authority in elaborate rituals, called herself a 'prince', and declined to marry. Unsurprisingly, tragedies and histories of the era dramatise crises of royal succession and related political instability through complex explorations of tyranny and treachery that disturb binary definitions of gender. Comedies often resolve these crises through marriage but are likewise populated by articulate female characters and driven by gender disguise. All of this cultural work took place in a new and radically public space and was governed by an aesthetics ofÂ  self-reflexivity. What can we learn from these plays and this epoch about the relationship between gender, sex, performance, and political power? In this course you will learn to read early modern plays informed by an understanding of their theatrical and socio-political origins and to reflect on their legacies in modern entertainment and public life. Playwrights to be studied include Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson, William Shakespeare, and Elizabeth Cary.", "outcome": "Read closely and understand a range of early modern plays.Identify themes and formal characteristics of early modern drama.Analyse a play-text in the light of its socio-political context.Direct a scene from an early-modern play-text with reference to original staging conditions.Reflect on practice-based research findings in the light of published scholarship on a gender-related topic in early modern drama." }

Is there such a thing as the 'ethnic vote'? What are the political behaviours of ethnic, 'racial' and religious minorities in comparison to citizens from majority groups? What are the sources of mobilization for minority political participation? What are the individual, cultural and structural barriers to full participation among MEM groups within Western democracies?

{ "code":"PHIL2125", "title":"Thesis in International Security Studies", "description": "This course examines what it means to be 'rational' in negotiating the world and conducting one's life. At issue is the quality of one's beliefs, desires and choices about how to act, particularly in the face of uncertainty, and in concert with others.Part I is a critical examination of the standard theory of individual rationality - expected utility theory - that unites and explicates the aforementioned key mental attitudes. This theory stems from the classic work of philosophers/social scientists such as Ramsey, de Finetti and Savage. Contemporary challenges to the standard theory come from diverse directions, with some arguing that the theory is too little constrained and even vacuous, others arguing that it is too rigid, either in its prescriptions for representing and handling uncertainty or else by virtue of being in conflict with some prominent ethical accounts of right action, and yet others arguing that it gives outright bad advice in various special cases. The course considers these challenges to the standard theory and the responses/developments they have inspired.Part II turns to rationality in a social context. The initial focus is the theory of games, applicable to cases where what an individual should do depends on what others do, and vice versa. Standard solution concepts for games are introduced, and the collective-action problems that may arise, including possibilities for their resolution, are considered, with an eye to the ethical significance of these scenarios. Finally, the course turns to group choice proper, where individuals effectively join forces and act as a single entity. Here the starting point for investigation is Arrow's theorem regarding the (im)possibility of an adequate group aggregation of individual attitudes; this invites examination of Arrow's assumptions, and raises further questions regarding interpersonal comparability and the plausibility of Utilitarianism and other aggregative solutions.Â ", "outcome": "Understand and articulate key philosophical issues pertaining to rational choice and inference, both for individuals and groupsEngage with and critically evaluate (in essay form) formal and discursive material relevant to individual, game and social choice theoryEngage in well-reasoned, justified and articulate discussion and debate.  " }

In the middle of the 20th century, in the aftermath of the Second World War, policy-makers became aware that the terms of peace could have a powerful impact on the likelihood of return to conflict. Significant progress has been made in developing peace-making processes that undercut the original causes of conflict and which thus diminish the possibility that conflict will recur. Architectures of international cooperation and inter-dependence also work to diminish the possibility of war.Â The historical memory of conflict, however, has proven to be a serious and intractable obstacle to international harmony. The historical bitterness that afflicts Japan's relations with Korea and China is greater now than at any time since the Second World War.

The memory of the massacre of communists in Indonesia 50 years ago looms as an issue in contemporary Indonesian politics.Â Meanwhile, formal and informal reconciliation process in various countries of the region (including Korea, Cambodia and East Timor) have shed light on possible paths to preventing the legacies of bitter histories from causing ongoing conflict.This course will critically analyse the processes used in dealing with the past, as well as the prospects and challenges for cooperation and reconciliation.Â Â ", "outcome": "nan" }
